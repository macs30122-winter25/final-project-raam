## Project Overview

### Research Question & Relevance

Team RAAM is studying the changes in anxiety in essential workers on Reddit in comparison to the general population during the onset of COVID-19. Our primary research question is:

- **How did COVID-19 impact the different types and rates of anxiety in essential worker positions compared to the general population?**

To address this, we analyze text data scraped from Reddit subreddits related to different worker populations: `r/Nursing` (healthcare workers), `r/Teachers` (education workers), and `r/HealthAnxiety` (general anxiety discussions). Additionally, we compare this to anxiety data from external sources such as the CDC and WHO.

Using **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques such as **VADER sentiment analysis** and **LIWC**, we identify anxiety trends, classify different types of anxiety, and compare rates of increase across different groups.

### Summary of Main Findings 

- There was an increase in anxiety in the first half of 2020 shown in scraped and supplementary datasets.
- `r/Nursing` displayed higher rates of anxiety on average than `r/Teachers`
- Anxiety reached its peak around the middle of 2021 in all three subReddits.
- However, while anxiety increased in the first half 2021 on all the subReddits, anxiety levels declined in the general American adult population.

## Use of AI
We have consulted ChatGPT for writing our functions, but all the code should be reproducible without the use of AI.
