I've been teaching undergrads for about 3 years and I FINALLY figured out how to get them to ask questions about the material!,"I teach a class of 40-70 students. Every class I assign reading, and every class I'd come in and say, ""Does anyone have any questions about the material?"" And I'd be faced with stony silence, so I'd move on with my lecture or whatever. Recently I figured out a technique that works great for forcing student engagement in lots of circumstances, and realized it would work for this simple question.
At the beginning of class I say, ""Take out a piece of paper. Write down one thing that you found confusing or unclear about the reading. If you totally understood it, write down one follow-up question or something you'd like to further understand. Don't hand them in. I will be calling on you randomly so write something down."" Then after a minute or so I just say, ""Ok before I start calling on people, who has a question they want to read?"" And TA-DA!!! Tons of questions about the material.  Good ones, that had me answering questions for most of the class rather than just lecturing at the class.

Parents - you're failing your kids by preventing them from failing,"Pardon the rant. I'm over it.
I am irritated that parents aren‚Äôt letting their kids fail. I don‚Äôt have kids, but I was a kid whose mom let me fail, and miraculously, I learned from it and never made that mistake again. It was in 7th grade, the grade I currently teach. I waited until literally the night before our science fair project was due to begin it. My mom did not help. My mom did not write email after email to my teacher making excuses, begging for more time, and spinning a sob story of how hard I tried. No, my mom let me fail. I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúfail.‚Äù I probably earned a C, but for a student who typically earned As, it was a failure to me. While I may have procrastinated a few times after, it was never to the extent of what happened with that science fair project. Parents: You are failing your child by not letting them fail. One ‚ÄúC‚Äù in middle school isn‚Äôt the end of the world, and it‚Äôs much better to earn that C in middle school rather than in high school where the GPA counts more heavily. GPA isn‚Äôt really a thing in middle school until 8th grade. Your child should not have waited until the DAY BEFORE THE EXTRA CREDIT was due to begin it. Your child should know how to check and read his emails. Your child should know that he will not get credit for plagiarizing his assignment. Your child would have those horrible feelings of failure and disappointment to motivate him not to make those mistakes again if you hadn‚Äôt sent me a barrage of emails, if your husband, a 35-year veteran teacher who apparently has no clue what plagiarism is, hadn‚Äôt sent me emails, and if administration hadn‚Äôt stepped in to force my hand to offer your precious baby a second chance on extra credit. In the future, just tell me what grade you want your kid to have. It will save both of us time and frustration.",1.14,0,1.14,0,0.57,0.57
"I Almost Quit, but Decided to Just Teach","I went into this school year ready for anything. That ""anything"" didn't include 95% of what hit me like a freight train in just my first week. The kids that got dropped in my lap this year were beyond anything I ever expected. 
On day 1, I had a student (5th Grade ELA) stand on his desk and beat on his chest while screaming absolute nonsense. It wasn't even words. It was just guttural noise. This student proceeded to jump down and crawl on the floor across my classroom. All I could do was stand there and think ""What the absolute fuck is happening?"". This same phrase has now become a constant in my mind.
I spent my first entire month crying after work on my drive home. Between the kids, constant crazy expectations, PD days everytime I turned around, and the ""can you help out with this or that"", I was dying. I seriously went to my doctor and asked him to please give whatever drugs, even experimental, you can to just help me handle all of this. *He didn't do that, but did adjust some of meds to help with my anxiety. 
My biggest problem was that I wanted to teach, but felt like I was being pulled in some many different directions that I wasn't even allowed to do my actual job. The night before I was about to put in my 2 week notice, it hit me. They aren't going to fire me for not complying to half of the shit that they are wanting me to do. I'm ready to quit, so being fired, isn't too much different (I know recommendations are needed on a resume, of course). 
I decided to teach, really teach. If our district office came by to look at my data wall, I was already prepared to tell them "" Dat a Wall ain't a happening"". I broke all of the stupid rules. I never had my students open their textbooks that I hated. I read 2 different novels and did activities with those novels that the kids loved. I refused meetings that weren't beneficial or related to my actual planning during my planning period. I also quit working, grading, or planning after school. My room or lessons aren't Pinterest perfect anymore, but that's okay.
I was constantly second guessing my new approach, but I was happier. My students were also generally doing better. They were and are still crazy, but we've all developed a relationship in which we are able to manage it. 
So, did this work? As in, did my mandatory 9 week benchmark tests satisfy those above me? Did my craziness with the intention of doing what I felt was best for my students actually work? It actually did!!!! My 5th graders performed on their 9 weeks benchmark test higher than my class the year before. Their overall proficiency was higher than their beginning of the year benchmark and state test from last school year. 81% of all of my students passed that damn test too. My 5th graders also scored 15% higher on all aspects of the test compared to the rest of the district. 
TLDR: I said fuck the crazy expectations and just focused on teaching even if it meant getting fired, because I was already ready to quit. I ended up having a group that performed better than they ever have on our stupid benchmark tests.",1.38,0.35,0.52,0.17,0.17,0.17

I talked to my students about their weekend plans and noticed a pattern: sleepovers, birthday parties, soccer games, hockey practice, etc. 
It just makes me wonder WHY are we busting our asses at the school level to keep kids apart when they spend their days off together? Teachers in my building are lambasted for not being able to keep kids 6ft apart during mask breaks or transition time, but NOBODY seems to care about what kids are doing outside of school.

Switching to Online Teaching,"A bit long, but I get these questions and comments a lot lately. ""What's it like online teaching?"" ""Are you still working?"" ""Must be nice to have a break, haha""
Switching to online teaching is a bit like being a chef at a fancy restaurant that flooded. Now I cook from a food truck, but my community expects the same dining experience.
Normally, I carefully pick herbs and vegetables from the garden (that I grow myself), buy protein from various farms, and order in special items. I spent all year creating my menu and ordering all the food, but I had to throw out half of it because I can‚Äôt prepare it the same way in my food truck.
I cook meals for 125 kids a day, 5 days a week. I set the table with dishes and cutlery that I carefully polish, and bring in my own flowers, candles, and tablecloths to make it a welcoming dining experience. I invite all of my kids (and even parents) to dine at my restaurant.
44 diners do not show up, even though they said they would come. I can see them walking by the restaurant, but despite asking them repeatedly to come in and eat for free, they don't want to. I phone, email, text, and video conference with them and their parents, but it's like they've completely vanished.
11 claim they don‚Äôt know where the restaurant is, despite dining here the whole year. I email them a map. They arrive. They claim they don‚Äôt know how to eat lobster. I show them how. Their parents phone and want instructions on how to eat lobster. I also show them how with instructions, a video, and several books on the subject. The kid decides they don‚Äôt like lobster, even though they haven‚Äôt taken a single bite. I offer them a different dish. They leave. Their parents complain that I didn‚Äôt feed them. They leave after the first week.
12 complain about the food selection, even though I have carefully adapted my menu to serve vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian, paleo, low-sodium, low-carb, gluten-free, and check for allergens for each kid. I went to several meetings and courses to learn how to make these dishes. Their parents complain because I didn‚Äôt have a keto plate. Two parents thanks me for the support with their kid's low-sodium meals. They leave the restaurant after two weeks, but I still have to call and see if they want to come and eat. I feel like an annoying telemarketer, they don‚Äôt even pick up the phone now.
10 want me to cut up their steak into little bites and then spoon-feed them their meal. They ask every night for this, even though I've been working all year to try and get them to eat on their own. I can't serve other kids because I get tied up trying to feed so many individuals. Sometimes I will get lucky and can get a waiter to help me cut up the food, but with budget cuts, my restaurant can't afford that many waiters. I wonder why their parents haven‚Äôt taught them how to use utensils yet, but quickly find out that their parents have been cutting their food for them their whole lives. They leave after the third week.
5 kids show up at 5pm, 9pm, 3am, and on weekends and want me to feed them, despite having my hours posted and well-communicated. I still feel bad for not feeding them.
8 kids want me to deliver the food to them. It‚Äôs a bit more work, but I have no problems doing it. I adapt my menu so they get hot food, and I even use my own plates. When the waiters deliver the food now, they won‚Äôt answer the door. I never get my plates back.
7 kids leave their food virtually untouched, only picking out the pieces they like and leaving the rest. Their parents want to know what their kid ate every day, even though they could simply ask their kid. Or check their dining app. Or their emails.
12 kids show up when their parents force them, pretend to eat the food, but actually dump their plate into the trash can when their parents aren't looking. I ask them if they want another plate, but they don't respond. They show their parents the empty plate, and parents are too busy to notice. I don't blame the parents because I know they're stressed and overworked, but I still worry about their kids.
16 kids show up on time, eat the food, and even say thank-you. They fill my heart so full I could cry. I want to hug their parents. I am so thankful for these students because they remind me why I chose to become a chef for a living. It's not a job, it's a career and a large part of my identity.
Running the food truck is exhausting, but the relaxed dress code is a perk. I‚Äôm lucky because I don‚Äôt have my own kids to feed and nurture, on top of running the restaurant. I don‚Äôt know how those chefs do it. I hope I can go back to my restaurant, but with the flooding, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll have a job there in the fall. I wonder if all chefs feel this way.

"My district went 4 days per week, and it has been a life saver.","My district went to a block hybrid situation a few weeks ago, but they kept Wednesdays as an asynchronous day.
On Wednesdays, I give my kids check-in questions and super short vocab assignments (because I still have to take attendance and assign some kind of work). But I get a whole day to plan lessons, grade papers, contact parents, check in with kids, etc.
It has seriously been a game changer. My stress and anxiety has plummeted, and my lessons have gotten so much better.
I know that 4 days/week won't stick around next year, but I really appreciate the way my district has handled this situation. They have  done an amazing job of meeting the needs of both students and teachers.

1) An ""expert"" who hasn't taught in 10 years, or taught for 3 years and then became a consultant, presenting theory that is nearly impossible to implement. (Even worse is the academic ""expert"" who never taught and went immediately to grad school, but thinks all teachers are brain dead, bigoted assholes who hate children)

"I'm teaching cursive, and it's one of the best decisions I've made.","I've scrapped the structured Morning Meeting in favor of Cursive Morning Wake-Up, where my third graders spend their first 20 minutes easing into the day by learning a new letter and practicing with it.

I'm also circling the room like a helpful shark, giving praise and advice.
It's such a lovely way to start the day, you guys. It seems to help them get into the learning mindset first thing - cursive is a very grown-up skill, and progress is easy for them to discern. Plus, not only do the kids love learning it, I've had at least a half dozen parents thank me for teaching it.

No more PD from speakers who abandoned the classroom,"Apologies in advance for this rant... My district recently had a PD session addressing the issue of burnout--good for them for recognizing the problem--but the speaker was condescending and awful. I won't name them or their program. They started off talking about how stressful their four or five years in the classroom were. Then during a cry in the parking lot they apparently had this wild revelation about needing to feel burned-in instead of burnt-out. They left the classroom and opted for the PD circuit instead.
Coming at the end of a school year where my school had four different schedules and all of us felt like first-year teachers again, the PD speaker's presentation felt downright insulting. They haven't been in the classroom for at least four years. They didn't experience spring 2020. They haven't seen any of the stress and horror we've seen this year. To be blunt, the speaker couldn't hack it in a regular classroom and decided to make themselves feel good telling other professionals how to do a job they couldn't handle for themselves. I had a student teacher last semester. I would rather listen to an eight-hour presentation from her than five minutes from the burnt-in speaker because at least my former student teacher understands what we've gone through this year. 
This is not to say that any PD speaker who left the classroom shouldn't speak to teachers. There are some phenomenal people out there who have earned the right to tell us how to improve. Manny Scott, in particular, is an absolute inspiration. I love him and his books. 
On the PD evaluation, I and my PLC wrote we would walk out if administration ever invited that speaker back again. After all we've been through, administrators must be more careful in who they select to come see us and tell us how to improve in our jobs. They have to get people who understand what the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 years have been like for us. The PD speaker circuit is filled with people who abandoned their classrooms a long time ago and wouldn't last a week in today's classrooms.

As a father with an immunocompromised child, the future is looking pretty grim if we have a traditional opening in the fall. I‚Äôm not sure what steps I should take right now. Examine leave options? Contact the union? I‚Äôm not one to stir things up, but this was unacceptable.",0.58,0,0.58,0,0,0.58

I wanna know how I can make my teachers jobs easier.,"Hello. I‚Äôm a 9th grade freshman student attending public school. I made this post because I just want a teachers stance on this question.
I‚Äôve noticed that a lot of my teachers appear stressed and irritated. Especially the ones at the end of the day. A lot of my classmates work hard to make the teachers miserable, and it makes me sad to see my teachers who work hard have their jobs complicated. 
I try to make my teachers happier by asking questions and being involved in the lesson and making sure my work is turned in. But I wanna know what other little things I can do to make my teachers happier, wether it‚Äôs assignment and grade related or social skills related. 
Thank you and have a good day!",4.26,1.42,2.84,0.71,0.71,0.71
"Impromptu parent conference ... Kid doesn't recognize me, her teacher","Parent snags me at the school board meeting for a quick conference after another teacher introduces us. The fact that her child didn't recognize me should have been her first clue the kid was nothing but lies.
Kid isn't really doing work and not coming to virtual meetings. Mom isn't coming AT me but she is wondering why her kid is failing every single assignment.
Me: Are you having trouble getting to the lessons for when you miss zoom?
Kid: What lessons?
Mom: . . .
And I think we've just discovered why your child is failing. 
The kid then admitted to going to assignments through the calendar rather than the folders with the materials.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I Learned Why You Never Use a Random Kahoot,"My honors class finished so early that they had time for two Kahoots! They did my Kahoot on Situational Irony in 10 instead of the 15 I anticipated. 
So I pulled up one on Dramatic Irony that I found. I only checked to see how many questions it had and not much else. We start playing and one of the slides ask, ‚ÄúTrue or false: Is this dramatic irony?‚Äù 
It was a picture of Stevie Wonder that read, ‚ÄúI may be blind, but at least I‚Äôm not black.‚Äù 
I‚Äôm glad they asked it fast enough that I could just skip past it. They were already cracking up though. I apologized profusely and said I wouldn‚Äôt ever use a kahoot I didn‚Äôt make again. 
The only bright side is the students said they won‚Äôt forget dramatic irony now! I just hope to high heaven I don‚Äôt get an email or phone call about it.",1.23,1.23,0,0,0,0
Surprise from my students,"(We are in-person teaching)

"""In person"" learning is just distance learning but in person?","My school is doing a hybrid of at home and in class.  So I need to have lessons which are possible to do at home as well as in class.  Which means that all of my students are working on their little school-issued laptops through my entire class - and all of their other classes.  Their desks are separated so they can barely talk to each other (no complaining about that!).  What's the point of having in person learning if they're just staring at their screen the whole time?
I know that lots of parents are mad that they want in person learning, and I know that schools are trying their best to tailor to all students in class and at home... but in terms of risk:reward, it seems like we're risking our health/lives (not a huge risk, but a risk nonetheless) so that students can sit in school and do work on their laptops instead of sitting at home and work on their laptops... there's zero reward for doing this.  They might as well stay home. Am I alone on this?",1.04,0,1.04,0,0.52,0
Dress Code Police!,"I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it again.  I fucking despise enforcing petty bullshit dress codes.  I am the morning bus teacher.  I am the first adult contact with all students and my principal told me yesterday that we‚Äôve had a lot of kids coming in with hoodies and no collared shirts.
Now I have to check for shirts for damn near every student walking by.  And this morning I‚Äôve already caught 10 kids. And duty is only halfway done.  To me, big fucking deal.  Whatever. 
But one of the superstar softball girls came in with just a hoodie and I pulled her aside.  A coworker let her go and told me I was being a dress code nazi and now I‚Äôm on a power trip?  
I hate dress code policy.",1.48,0,1.48,0,1.48,0

Lockdown is showing us what people really think the role of a school is,"With social services stretched beyond limits, youth services non existence and community services cut beyond recognition, every discussion about schools reopening focuses on childcare, free school meals, child abuse... not children‚Äôs learning. My school has counsellors, a physiotherapist, a nurse, a police officer. Our pastoral team have organised food banks, collections of clothing and essentials, pressured landlords, sorted benefit claims.  The children‚Äôs access to these services have been discussed so much more than the academic progress of the pupils this month. Parents/politicians/non-educators are not at all concerned about the literacy / numeracy level of the children dropping (some could argue lock down has made parents critical of large parts of the academic side of school) but everyone wants the social services provided by the school back.
I‚Äôm not saying whether this new role of the school is a problem or not, it‚Äôs certainly a massive topic. But maybe it‚Äôs time to admit that social care is a major role of schools and start allocating the funding, training and resources with this in mind? Even having a school‚Äôs social support mentioned in their rankings/reviews/inspections would be a start.
I‚Äôm a new teacher, would love to hear some thought? I think this is going to be a big area of debate soon enough",1.75,0.88,0.44,0,0.44,0
Can you hold your breath?,"So every year we do a fun staff picture where about 50 staff members stand in close proximity (shoulder to shoulder). We are back, fully face to face with PD this week. Some staff members whined because they don‚Äôt want to wear a mask for the picture. So my principal emailed and asked us all if we were willing to take off our masks real quick and just ‚Äúhold our breath for three seconds.‚Äù I said I didn‚Äôt think it was worth the risk, and was told I could have the option of wearing a mask, but am I ok with others not. There was also a group of teachers that wouldn‚Äôt wear masks at their table during PD because they ‚Äúhung out all summer.‚Äù Will they accept that excuse from their students?

Saw one of my kids out in the wild,"This morning I realized we were almost out of bread so I loaded up and masked my kids to make a quick trip to the grocery store. After we had checked out and had gotten back in the car, one of my high school students pulled in beside us. 
That poor boy. I rolled down my window and hollered his name. I‚Äôm pretty sure I embarrassed him, but it was so good to talk to him for a minute. He apologized for not doing well on the online portion and I reassured him all I cared about was that he was doing okay and told him I hoped to see him in August.
