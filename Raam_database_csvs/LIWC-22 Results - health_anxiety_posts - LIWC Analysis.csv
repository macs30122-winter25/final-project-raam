IM NOT A DOCTOR, so only read further IF YOU'VE BEEN CHECKED OUT BY YOUR DOCTOR AND TOLD YOU'RE HEALTHY
I wrote a post with tips for Heart Health Anxiety a while back; I've been struggling with some health anxiety in the past few days and I wanted to put some of the things that help me calm down in here; 
​

A heart can either be healthy or sick. There's no in-between option. 

A healthy heart is one that's been checked by doctors, in some cases, multiple times and by multiple doctors and they've all agreed that there's nothing wrong with it. The heart is obviously a vital organ so if there was something seriously wrong it would show symptoms. But get this : It would show symptoms CONSTANTLY;  
It wouldn't be like ""Oh, let me hurt a bit, then calm down for the rest of the day and tomorrow I'll get a few palpitations and then be fine for a few weeks and then act up again""; Uh uh. That is how a HEALTHY heart acts when being confronted with other things such as: stress, anxiety, food consumption, alcohol, sleep (or lack of it), smoking, hard exercise, hormones; 
A sick heart would let you know. There would be symptoms that don't go away. A swelling in legs that lasts weeks, pain that never stops, breathing issues that get worst through months etc; And for all of you that have been checked by doctors and told all clear - a sick heart would show up on every, no matter how basic, of a test  doctors do. It would show up in blood works, it would show up in EKG, it would show up during a basic listen of the heart that doctors do all the damn time, every time you go and ask for a check up. The symptoms of a sick heart do not hide. They make themselves present and every doctor will be able to see them and send you for further help asap; 
​

  A sudden heart attack/cardiac arrest can happen under only a few circumstances:

​
- Your heart is sick/born with a defect from birth; These types of sudden heart attacks/arrest are often if not always the result of someone not having symptoms and NOT CHECKING their heart fully; They're usually quite young people who's never been to a doctor to get their heart checked and just assume that theres nothing wrong with them. I have a friend, 22F, with no symptoms that went for a day-to-date easy check up and the doctor heard a murmur in her heart straight away and now she knows what to do and what not to do; If your doctor has checked you and told you your heart is healthy that means its just that - healthy with no birth defect;
​
- You've lived usually 40+ years of unhealthy lifestyle and you're probably also dealing with other issues such as high cholesterol, arteries build up etc, things that doctors, AGAIN, would have caught by now and told you to be careful and change your lifestyle for the better if you don't want to suffer a heart attack. 
​
- An accident, like getting electrocuted; 
​
A healthy heart does not just GIVE UP without outside force making it do so. 
That outside force can also be food, stress, sedentary lifestyle, but these are all things you can help yourself with; If it's something you can't help, like lets say hormones during period/pregnancies  (like it was for me) or work related stress, all you can do is wait it out and believe it will come to an end; It always does; 
​

 People who are perfectionists and good at focusing at a specific task until they fix the problem can and most likely will induce their own heart symptoms; I know that I do. I'm not much of a perfectionist myself, but I can focus very strongly on things that I deem important; If there's a problem I'll focus on it until I've made it go away. However, example, focusing on a heart palpitations I've got only makes me more stressed which in result brings even more palpitations and the circle begins; Realising that you're good at focusing can help you next time a symptom appears and your first instinct is to focus on it, examine it from all sides, think of all possible outcomes and completely ruin your mental peace in the process which leads to even more anxiety and even more symptoms; 

​
Its nearly impossible to STOP focusing on something that scares you; So the alternative is, instead of stopping the focus, to shift it to LOGIC. Shift it to past experiences when you've had this symptom and it's gone away on its own; Shift to doctors telling you you're fine. Shift to ""I just had a lot of chocolate today"", ""its hormones"", ""Its just stress""; And no, this is not ignoring the problem. Believe me, I've been there and I'd tell myself ""what are you doing!!! How can you try to calm yourself that its just stress?? What if this time its not??? What if this time you're really really dying???!!?""... and well, the simple ""what if THIS TIME"" in there should be enough to remind me that its happened before and well, I'm still here; 
​
I hope this helps you a bit; Remember, you can always get checked by a doctor, even if its your 100th time, if that brings you peace, there's no shame in that; I hope you feel better vey soon and have a wonderful day! :)",3410,Create an account,https://old.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/bimyyl/for_people_with_heart_health_anxiety/,,,,,1,937,20.28,41.95,55.55,15.46,39.04,5.87,2.67,3.09,3.31,0.96,2.35,1.28,0,0,0.11,8.86,2.56,0.64,0,0.11,0.43,0.96,6.3,0.11,0.11,0.21,0,0,0,0,0,2.24,0,0,2.03,0.21,0,9.39,6.19,1.71,0.75,0,0.11,0.11,0.43,0.11,0.11,0.43,0.85,0.11,0.21,0,6.4,4.59,6.4,0.96,18.57,2.24,5.12,0.96,0.64,3.31,6.3,0
2,2018-08-18T22:29:24+00:00,bamsurk,My health anxiety has gone and so can yours. It’s a state of mind!,"Hey listen,
I have been where you have been, I’m 27 years old and in the past year I’ve had the following “symptoms” :

twitching all over my body
numb arms in the morning
such blurry vision I couldn’t read the computer
dizziness (I constantly felt drunk)
Yellow shits with bits in (purely from worry and anxiety, anxiety makes your digestion super fast)
stomach ache
Spasming stomach
bloating which was so uncomfortable
constant acid reflux
a white covered tongue 
inability to think, unable to concentrate completely zoned out like a zombie
heart jumps and scares
Bloodshot eyes
chest tightness and pain
headaches
migraines with aura
ear ache
ringing in my ear
crawling sensation in my ear
ulcers like all the time
felt weak (e.g. In the gym)
Nausea
Back pain
Joint pain
jittery jaw/ involuntary jaw moving
swollen lymph nodes
numbness and tingling down one side of face 

As a result of this I had the following tests:

1 MRI
About 30 blood tests (diabetes, thyroid, full blood count you name it, I’ve had it)
About 5 stool tests
1 ECG
2 “emergency” hospital rushes
1 x-Ray
Ears checked multiple times
Saw an ENT specialist twice
Saw a neurology specialist
Had an oral cancer screening (have a single tonsil up)
Had a mole checked
got a lump in my tongue checked
(Definitely had more than this too)

Paid privately for screenings and all sorts (I’m from the UK so healthcare is free)
I’ve convinced myself I’ve had the following illnesses at times:

MS
Lymes disease
Skin cancer
Oral cancer
Bowel Cancer
A Stroke
Brain tumor
Heart attack
Etc etc....

Guess how many things I had wrong with me?
ZERO!
I was worried about a few things, one was a lump in my tongue which the doctor said was fine, and now I’ve learnt to accept that they are right.
I’m still here, I still have the lump, everything is okay and it’s the same for you.
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
The best things you can do to help yourself are:
1) DO NOT FUCKING GOOGLE EVER
I stopped googling about 2 months ago, been 100x better ever since.
Has google ever helped you identify a killer disease? Nope didn’t think so.
2) TRY TO BE RATIONAL
The best thing you can do if you think something is wrong is tell yourself:
“okay I have found this, what is the most likely cause”
(the most likely thing is that it is something benign) 
“okay then I will wait for 2 weeks and then go to the doctor”
9.9 times out of 10 it will be gone
3) REALISE THAT YOU HAVE TO DO THIS YOURSELF - IGNORE YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS MIND AND TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR THOUGHTS
Are you going to honestly let your own brain control how you feel for the rest of your life? Take the time to take control now. It’s honestly completely in your control.
Take a moment and consider what you are doing, there are two people in your head, your conscious self (if you choose to think something) and your unconscious self, which is there doing its own thing.
The unconscious self will make you think things are wrong with you, but you need to take control and not let it control you. As soon as you let yourself think you have something your body will feel as if you have it.
It sounds dumb as fuck, but you need to choose to be healthy, choose that you are okay. Because by choosing that you’re not okay.... shock you’re not okay!
Every single one was manifested by myself cos I allowed myself to get so worked up and stressed.
4) LOOK AFTER YOURSELF
Sleep, exercise etc will help. I had a vitamin D deficiency which was definitely contributing to my anxiety, get a test for that if you don’t get much sun, almost everyone is deficient in it.
Heck take a low dose regardless the placebo effect might help!
5) THINK ABOUT THE PAST
How many times have we been though this? How many times have you had a deadly infections disease?
Are you dead?
No. Why? Because the average life expectancy is like 80 years old....
6) BELIEVE YOUR DOCTOR
How many times have you seen a doctor? How many times were they right? 
“But they only looked for one second they must be doing a bad job” - no they’ve just seen whatever you’re showing them 39728364 times before they know what good looks like. If they were worried they would look for longer.
These people are medical professionals because they love people, including you.
7) THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE
Would you rather spend the rest of your life, no matter how long or short it may be like this?
You’ve got shit to go and be successful at, and you sure as hell will struggle if you let something consume you like anxiety will.
It’s no good being alive but not living, go and live!
8) DON’T FUCKING GOOGLE
Just incase you didn’t read the first time.
9) TALK TO PEOPLE
More people have anxiety than you think, almost everyone above like 25 has been anxious or depressed.
Therapy is good, get it if you can, but ultimately it’s up to you to take control and ‘make yourself healthy’
10)  STOP CHECKING STUFF
Poking, prodding, opening, touching all makes things dirty, swollen, irritated. Whatever is “wrong with you” will not go away if you keep fucking touching it.
Apply a rule to yourself like “I will leave it alone for 2 weeks and then go to the doctors” that will help you to filter things that do and don’t matter more easily.
Finally:
Oh and I am not a medical professional and nothing I’ve written is medical advice. You should listen to what your doctor tells you.... which I am guessing is that you have anxiety, which is why you’re on here searching for answers. You won’t find them here, nor will you find anything wrong with you!
Go and enjoy your life, go socialise, make a stand, like I said I don’t have anxiety anymore, I stopped one day and said fuck this, I’m choosing to not have this anymore and it’s gone, it’s a state of mind and you can control your own brain IF TOU CHOOSE TOO!
If you want anything or someone to talk too message me. I’ve not been anxious for at least 2 months now.
————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Edit:It's now been 6 months since I posted this, I consider my HA to be gone now, I default to the 'normal' rational thought process that everyone else uses. Honestly stop googling and start living.
3 year update.
Wow where did that time go?
Life has never been better. I don’t panic about my health, I don’t obsess or check things, I don’t google, I accept I will one day die, I don’t stress about it because what will be will be, I accept that of the 100s of times I have worried in the past so far 0 of them have been a cause for concern, I no longer stress myself out about my health.
I live. It’s that simple.
Good luck everyone, you can take control and move on with your life, it really is in your hands, no one will do it for you.

So anxiety can make you feel like your dying we all know that. These symptoms also can last along time or a short time depends how stress you are and if you still are and have those obsessive thoughts. Anxiety is evil and we all wish it to disappear. I’m here to tell you guys what anxiety can do physically and mentally 
It can do so much physically 
It can cause Weakness of the body and it can affect one side, one limb, or the whole entire body
It can make muscle twitches and muscle spams happen anywhere. Even in places that don’t have muscles and they can last along time sadly.
It can cause burning, numbness, buzzing, zapping, vibrating, and other strange feeling that aren’t normal.
It can give you headaches and migraines that can last for days and weeks long.
It can make you feel like you have a shortness of breath or feel like it is hard to breathe.
It can make you heart beat faster and make you chest hurt from it and also cause palpitations.
It can make you nauseous and vomit.
It can make your stomach hurt and feel like your being punched from the inside.
It can make you have changes in bowel movements like constipation and diarrhea.
It can make you loose appetite or make you have more of a appetite. It also might make you feel like foods are gagging you.
It can make you urinate more often and may cause a burning sensation while you do but that is pretty rare. Also could cause you to have a weak stream or make it hard to be in general.
It can cause blurry vision, floaters, tunnel vision, sometimes double vision, and other vision changes.
It can make you feel lightheaded and dizzy more often. Especially after standing up to quickly.
You can get dry mouth during this as well.
You can have trouble speaking like mumbling, stuttering, keep saying words over , and many other speech problems.
It can cause warm or cold rushes in the body and affect any part.
It can make your hair fallout easier.
It can cause a choking feeling in your throat, sore throat, can make it feel like a lump, and also other throat related problems.
It can make you body ache all over. From joint pain to just random leg pain. Also back pain and neck pain and also jaw pain. This can last for weeks or even longer.
Make you body feel fatigued like you can’t even open a water bottle or go up a flight a stairs.

It Can cause mood swing but only explainable ones.
It can make you more aware of what is happening in your surroundings or to your body.
It can make you hear things that aren’t there. Like someone’s voice or just a weird sound.
That all I can remember for now if I can think of anymore I’ll let you know. Remember that anxiety can pretty much do anything to the body and it is very aggravating and can make you feel like you have a serious condition. If you guys have anymore symptoms comment them bellow. Remember and try to stick with the facts that some diseases we are afraid of are very rare and try to avoid the what if.
Do not google anything you experience it pops up with the worst. Just googling muscle weakness is mind destroying and scary and they always put the worst first. If you guys ever feel alone or scared you can dm me I am happy to help.
Edit: thanks to someone in the comments the pointed out a mistake I made.
You can also get coldness it your fingers and toes.
You can also grind your teeth in your sleep causing tmj but that is easily treatable and in most cases fix themselves 
Also can make you have nightmares and dream a lot more even if the dreams don’t make sense and are random.
It also can cause night sweats
It increases the acid production in stomach which causes indigestion, heartburn, stomach uncomfortness.
It impacts on the balance of good and bad bacteria in gut.
It causes stomach gas even if you eat the right food.
It inputs alot in existing problem like IBS.
Also you can feel your heartbeat in the ears and feel it anywhere on the body.
Edit: These are symptoms of anxiety not a diagnosis but if your going through a troubling time and have been under a lot of stress and anxiety then these can relate but if they come out of no where not scared at all. Setup a visit with your gp and still there might be nothing wrong. It is ok to not feel good sometimes doesn’t mean you are dying of a terrible illness.
Also don’t be afraid to ask a gp even while you are stress. They will help a lot and if they don’t they aren’t a good gp,",1577,Create an account,https://old.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/i35htt/so_im_gonna_make_a_whole_list_of_what_health/,,,,,1,1121,13.17,85.36,10.02,1,15.57,6.42,1.16,5.17,4.1,0.54,3.39,1.52,0.27,0.36,0,10.79,1.96,0.36,0.09,0.09,0.18,1.25,8.74,0,0,0,0.27,0.18,0,0,0.18,0.45,0,0.09,0.36,0,0,8.74,3.57,1.87,0,0.36,0,0,0.45,0.18,0,0.36,0.62,0.18,0,0.18,3.12,0.62,11.15,0.71,9.81,6.33,1.96,0,0,1.34,0.18,0

If you have this problem for a long period and it’s extremely painful, simply stroll into a doctor and let them check you out. But if it’s just a little bit of tightness or pain (usually on the left side) when you’re feeling anxious then relax, it’s just anxiety! I’ve had this problem for a long time, going to bed and having a tight chest and worrying I was dying or not going to be able to breathe - or having a slight pain in my chest. I had x rays, went to the doctors multiple times, and I was also given the all clear simply because its just anxiety. 
You’re not going to stop breathing and you’re not going to fall down and die. If you are young and healthy especially, you have nothing to fear. 
DISCLAIMER - obviously if your symptoms are extreme and you are experiencing this frequently, go to a doctor and get checked out. Simple!
Don’t google your symptoms!

Many of us tell ourselves that we’ll move on from our anxiety once we get that “one more test” or that “one last doctor visit”. But the truth is we get that reassurance one more time, and it’s never enough. You’ll either worry that they missed something or worry about a new symptom. It is impossible to recover until you begin to live your life again, despite the symptoms. You HAVE to take that trip you’ve been dreading. You HAVE to go back to work and start making a career. You HAVE to start exercising, eating right, meditating, and seeing a mental health professional. And above all, you HAVE to be patient. One therapy session will not cure you, nor will one jog, or one healthy dinner. It can take MONTHS, if not years to get better. But don’t let this discourage you. I promise you, when you recover, you will be the strongest form of yourself you ever have been. You will be able to take on anything life throws at you, and you will never take anything for granted anymore. You will love, laugh, and live in ways you never thought possible. And when that day finally comes that you have to leave this earth, you will look back and be so proud. Your health anxiety wasn’t a curse. It was a message for you to become stronger. It was an opportunity. So seize it and put in the work, you’ll thank yourself later...

Reassurance will only give you temporary relief and as you get use to doing the same habit your anxiety will only get worse. If you truly want to heal you'll need to get use to not fearing your discomfort. There's a couple books that have tremendously helped me on a road to recovery. I recommend reading:
DARE by Barry McDonagh
and
Fuck Coping Start Healing by Dennis Simsek
Edit: Also, I get it, I was there and sometimes still am. I'd come here relieved to see others are going through the same thing. Then I noticed a pattern where I would constantly come back for the same sensation or a new sensation. It never ended and with each visit I noticed I could no longer be reassured as well as the last visit.
You might notice this pattern in-person as well where you ask your spouse, sibling or friend if they feel these things too. Part of healing anxiety is about building trust with your mind and body. I am still recovering but I see light at the end of the tunnel. This thing can be beat but you have to start with cutting the habit of always trying to seek reassurance.

7,2020-12-30T10:53:24+00:00,Easy_Register2504,TIP: Gas can mimic heart palpitations!,"Gas builds up incredibly easily in your body. 
Stress, beans, high fiber content, dairy, hormones, swallowing too much air when eating or drinking or even talking, etc...
ALL of these cause gas. 
Gas accumulates anywhere in the body. It’s not located just in your stomach. Gas bubbles WILL feel like heart palpitations. Gas/digestive issues WILL cause sudden bursts of adrenaline (that nervous feeling in your stomach that shoots down your arms and legs too), I have no idea why, but this happens to me constantly and it ALWAYS turns out to be a really bad fart, lol. Gas will cause pain literally anywhere too. Especially in your chest (left, right, center), abdomen, rib area, etc.  Gas WILL a feel like pressure or tightness in your stomach, abdomen, or chest. gas pain will feel sharp, dull, achy, etc.

Back in March I suffered with some throat infection and a few weeks later in the shower I noticed a pretty decent bump in my right neck. Of course I freaked out for a moment as google told me it’s a lymph node and I have some form of cancer or STD. Of course google also said to just see if it goes down/gets bigger and not to jump the gun.
I have spent the last couple months googling the same things over and over again and during that time I kept pushing and poking the lymph node literally every 5 seconds I would touch it. Didn’t matter if I was driving, working, watching a movie or cooking I had my hand on that spot.
I then started to do neck inspections, I would run my hands along my neck and I started to even dig in my collarbone(really rough also). Months after the first lymph node I found a tiny pea sized one at the bottom of my right neck and again freaked out.
Then a few months after that I found another pea sized at the top of my left neck and then a month ago I was digging in my collarbone and I hurt myself and then days later found a HUGE rock hard lymph node.
This all sent me into a horrible panic, I was convinced I had lymphoma or some form of cancer. Convinced myself it was metastatic cancer from somewhere else.
As I did with my original lymph node, I started poking and pinching these lymph nodes and continued googling and freaking out.
I never went to the doctor because I’m those types of hypochondriac where I won’t go to the doctor, I’ll just diagnose myself and cry about it.
Well, low and behold when I stop touching them, they instantly go down. The original one on my neck was almost completely gone but I started touching it again and it would flare up. Now my nodes never got huge and they have only decreased in size. Even the rock hard one in my collarbone is almost completely gone.
I spoke with a doctor and they told me that our bodies are amazing, they will fight viruses and illnesses and we won’t even know and these lymph nodes are just doing their jobs and if they get inflamed they may never go back down fully and will swell up again if we get sick.
My advice to everyone I see posting about lymph nodes, go to the doctor for your peace of mind but DON’T play with them, I am confirmation that if you play with them and hurt them they can’t heal. Don’t google and don’t diagnose.
Go to the doctor when worried but also know that our bodies are keeping us healthy and just because you notice something different doesn’t mean we are dying.
I am still learning this myself and I still google things but I know it’s reassuring to hear from people that have similar skin/body issues that turn out to be normal and not worst case scenario.

A few years ago I was deep in the trenches of health anxiety. I would Google symptoms, truly, 12 hours a day. One night I was cooking and suddenly had a bunch of concerning symptoms that I won’t get into and called 911 and told them I was having a heart attack. I laid down on the floor and texted me family goodbye. I must have really sold it on the phone because two fire trucks worth of firefighters and two paramedics stormed my apartment and put me on a stretcher. They did all the tests and then just as quickly filtered out until just one paramedic was left. He was probably in his mid 70’s. I was sure it was because I was too far gone to save but no. He quietly asked me if I had a history of panic attacks. I was so embarrassed. I burst into tears and confessed and he shared with me that his granddaughter had similar struggles. He told me to always remember a couple things, which I have noted below to the best of my recollection. 
First, it is almost never the worst case scenario. When you’re googling, you can almost always eliminate the worst diagnosis. Second, the things you see on the news are outliers and you never get the full story of someone’s health history or habits. When you see something like, “Healthy 32 year old drops dead after _____.”You can’t rest assured you don’t have the whole picture. 
It’s so simple and probable that everyone else already knows this but if it helps one person like it has me it was worth posting. 
Edit: So shocked and thankful for the awards. I was certain everyone was going to think it was old/obvious news. Encouraging to me that it helps others and giving me strength to keep going!

Most of the things we're worried about almost always have EXTREMELY dramatic symptoms.
Like, a heart attack, which is literally when your heart can't get fucking BLOOD, is not gonna have symptoms like, ""Oof ouch my chest is a little sore"". Fuck no. Its gonna be like, ""DAH SHIT DUDE MY CHEST IS LITERALLY GONNA EXPLODE AND NOW THERES A GODDAMN ELEPHANT ON MY CHEST"" If something wrong, its gonna make itself clear.
Another example, brain tumor, where a chunk of cells is disrupting function of YOUR FUCKING BRAIN, is not gonna have symptoms along the lines of, ""Man my head hurts a little, and it'll probably go away when I sleep it off."" It'll be more like, ""FUCK MY HEAD HURTS. WOAH IM BARFING A LOT RECENTLY. OH GOD I CANT WALK IN A STRAIGHT LINE WITHOUT DYING."" Which at that point, you should already know to go to the doctor. Brain aneurysm basically falls under this category too.
How about another example, as this is pretty fun. Sepsis. Your body is fucking dying. It's not a, ""Well I feel more tired than usual. Or I feel a little hot right now."" Its more like, ""DEAR GOD WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME, IM GON PASSOUT AND VOM, AND MY BRAIN IS LITERALLY FRYING IN MY SKULL.""

12,2020-11-08T21:12:16+00:00,pianofreak7,A post for those whose health anxiety centers around cancer,"I've had moderate health anxiety for the past couple years and it focuses mainly on cancer. I am always worried that I have some form of cancer (right now I think I have pancreatic cancer lmao) so I thought I'd share some statistics that help calm me down.
I'm using the United States as an example but the statistics are similar in all developed countries.
In the United States, there are 80 million people aged 20-39. Of those 80 million, only 9 thousand will die of cancer. Now, that sounds like a lot, so let's break it down.
9 thousands out of 80 million is a rate of 0.0001125.
Let's say you're 20 years old, how many friends would you have to have aged 20-39 for one to die of cancer in a given year?
Let's say you have 100 friends aged 20-39. How many are likely to die of cancer?
0.01125 of them. Not even 1.
Let's say now you have 1 thousand friends aged 20-39. How many are likely to die of cancer?
0.1125 of them. Not even 1.
Let's say you now have 10 thousand friends aged 20-39. How many are likely to die of cancer?
1.125. Finally, 1.
That means, you need to know 10 thousand people aged 20-39 to even meet one that dies of cancer in a given year. 
On top of this, you have to factor in the fact that some people are genetically pre-disposed to getting cancer, some people smoke or drink excessively, some people have been exposed to radiation or asbestos their whole lives, some people have weakened immune systems, some people neglect their symptoms until it's too late...

13,2018-04-03T03:29:00+00:00,LuckerCat,My Experience Overcoming Crippling Health Anxiety + Tips,"This post is about my experience with health anxiety and how I totally overcame it. I hope this can help someone out there going through probably the most scary time of their life.
The Beginning
A year and a half ago I developed the symptoms of dry eye syndrome (light sensitivity, trouble reading). Otherwise, I was a totally healthy 21 year old male. When I shared the symptoms with a relative, she convinced me it must be something terrible like diabetes or MS. Rather than immediately consult a doctor, I spent the next couple of weeks Googling symptoms. 
Sure enough, a few days after first reading the symptoms of MS, my left leg started to become relentlessly tense. One night, my leg continually tensed up every couple of minutes and made it impossible to sleep. When I finally got out of bed in the morning, I went to take a shower. In the hot shower, my head started to feel hot and I suddenly felt very nauseous. I ran over to the sink and dry heaved, and then my vision started to fade to black. After sitting down on the floor, my vision slowly came back - but I was already convinced something was seriously wrong with me.
Went to the E.R. - all tests came back clear and they sent me home. They didn't know what caused it, but said that sometimes it ""just happens."" In the back of my mind, I already ""knew"" that something was wrong with me and continued to Google symptoms to try and solve my own case. Over that next month, I went back to the emergency room 4 times, had an ambulance come to my house, and spent a night in the hospital. The time the ambulance came to my house, both of my arms had gone completely numb (from hyperventilation during a panic attack) and I was convinced I was going to die. I vividly remember the nurse asking me ""on a scale of 1/10, how much pain are you in?"" and I answered, ""I'm not in any pain - I just feel like I'm about to die.""
As far as I could tell, my body was being controlled by a mysterious illness that could suddenly onset at any time and make me feel like I was about to pass out. Every time I went to the emergency room I said basically the same thing: ""I feel light headed, like I'm going to pass out."" Only, of course, they knew that wasn't really what was happening because my blood pressure was always just fine. Unfortunately, no one really conveyed this to me.
I developed a severe case of agoraphobia. I went from being an independent adult male to sleeping in the same bed as my safe person again because I was so scared something was going to happen to me in my sleep. Because this all started with me passing out in the shower, I became deathly afraid of the shower. I didn't shower for almost two months. I couldn't really leave the house at all, and if I had to, I had to stay near my safe person at all times - I couldn't do something as simple as sit alone in a store. Even just walking into the store made me feel a strong, sudden wave of anxiety.
Turning The Corner
During my four emergency room visits and hospital stay, I had an unbelievable amount of tests done. I got two CT scans of my head, two chest xrays, an MRI, a heart echo, a stress test, about 20 blood tests, a 24 hour heart monitor, as well as many other tests. All came back negative, and oddly enough not one doctor ever mentioned the possibility that it could just be anxiety. I had to figure this out on my own.
The exact instant I realized I had health anxiety was when I finally realized that I could actually trigger my symptoms. For example, every time I would go to a doctor's appointment, I felt like I was going to pass out. This happened whether it was an appointment with my primary care physician or my ophthalmologist. I literally had to lay down in the waiting room of my ophthalmologist because I just felt so light headed when I would go there. But then, oddly enough, I noticed that the symptoms totally subsided on the way home every time. It seems almost impossible to not put two and two together here, but it took me months to realize that perhaps it was anxiety causing me to experience these symptoms and that this would explain why they onset right before going to a doctor's appointment. At this point, after Googling, I came across ""white coat syndrome,"" and I knew what I had.
I told my neurologist I thought it may just be anxiety. He said it was possible, but he wanted to run some more tests. I let him run the tests, but in the meantime I started to treat the anxiety on my own with lifestyle changes. I started going out for strenuous walks for thirty minutes a day as a form of exercise even though my heart felt like it was palpitating out of my chest and I was scared to death. I started forcing myself to do things on my own. The first thing I did on my own was stand in line without my ""safe person"" to get my allergy medication prescription at a pharmacy - I felt strongly like I was going to pass out and desperately wanted to go sit down, but the book I read said the only way I could treat the anxiety was to face the fear and try and force myself to pass out. Of course, I never did pass out - it was all in my head.
After just about a month of self care, my extreme agoraphobia was gone. I was taking showers again once a day and I was going out and doing things completely by myself. A few months later, I got an opportunity to take my treatment to the next level - move across the country to live with a friend for a couple of months. I took the opportunity to finally break away from my safe person all together, and it turned out to be the final piece. The remaining minor symptoms I had dissipated.
Conclusion
This is a heavily condensed version of my story - it would be nearly impossible to go into full detail, as this took place over a grueling 8-9 months. I would, however, like to list some of the symptoms I experienced that totally went away. I think this could be helpful to someone who has some of these symptoms and has been told its anxiety, but doesn't quite believe it or think they will go away. Don't get me wrong, if you have any of these symptoms and you haven't been checked out, you need to do that first. Until you remove that piece of doubt from your mind, your recovery will be much harder.
Symptoms I experienced at one point or another that are now totally gone

Panic attacks (4 E.R. visits in a month, 1 ambulance call. sensations of abnormal heart beat, sweating, arms going numb, hyperventilation)
Extremely tense, painful left leg (this happened for weeks at a time, caused by stress according to neurologist)
Constant eye twitching (not like tourettes, but rather a constant twitching sensation in the eyelid)
Sensation of abnormal heartbeat (I was obsessed with my heartbeat and convinced something was wrong with it, I could notice it at almost all times)
Feeling of not getting enough air in (this was a strong sensation I often had around bed time, I literally felt like I was just not breathing in enough air to survive)
Trying to control my breathing (this was one of the most frustrating symptoms - I could not seem to take my mind off of controlling my breathing, I found a simple cure for this in the section below)
Ringing in the ears (sometimes it was constant for days at a time, sometimes it was one of my ears suddenly ""going out"" for a few minutes)
Seeing things (shapes, colors, etc) when my eyes were closed (this is one of the weirdest ones, because at the time it greatly concerned me and I remember always paying attention to what I could see with my eyes closed, and now I can't even remember what they looked like or ever paying attention to that again)
Feeling of light-headedness (pretty self explanatory, very common in anxiety)
Arms going numb (this would happen any time I was in a stressful situation, for example before a doctor's appointment or even when I went and played poker a couple of months after I had mostly recovered and even then every time I bluffed my arms would start to tingle and eventually go borderline numb - was told this has to do with the adrenaline overloading my system 24/7)
Constantly feeling off balance, like the floor is a bouncy castle (I went to the doctor specifically for this issue as well, and he checked my ears and assured me this sensation was all in my head - and it turns out it was. Was a very freaky thing, I was literally having to lean on the countertops in the kitchen just to wash dishes at one point, and now it is totally gone).
Derealization (I would constantly get the sensation that my arms weren't really my arms, or that I couldn't feel my face - I would literally pinch my arms every few minutes just to make sure they were mine and that I could feel them).
Developed an extreme sensitivity to caffeine (used to drink 400+mg in the morning, now I couldn't even drink a cup of coffee without feeling sick to my stomach, doctor told me to quit altogether so I tapered off until I quit)
Constantly lifting my arms, smiling due to fear of having a stroke (since one time the doctor mentioned I may of had a minor stroke, I became obsessed with lifting my arms to make sure one wasn't weaker than the other and smiling to make sure my face wasn't drooping)
The list goes on and on. Much of the stuff I am no doubt forgetting.

Tips

Start an exercise program. Much of anxiety is simply excess energy that needs to get expended. It's much harder to be anxious when you are tired, and besides if you have anxiety related to your heartbeat this is a way to face that. The first few days I was convinced my heart was beating like crazy just when walking, but the more you do it the less it happens and eventually it goes away all together. The goal is to desensitize yourself from focusing on your heart beat.
ALWAYS face your fears. Every time you give in to anxiety, it grows a little bit. Every time you face it, it shrinks a little bit. This is the basis of all treatment for anxiety. Anxiety makes you uncomfortable, but it is not harmful. The goal is to recognize that it is purely discomfort and there is really nothing to be afraid of.
For dealing specifically with the focusing on breathing thing, I recommend a great article here. This article literally single handedly cured this symptom, and this is the one that I experienced the longest of all of them. Even after everything was gone, I could not seem to stop focusing on my breathing. The gist of the article is that you are doing this because you are scared of the thought of focusing on your breathing, you are scared by the idea that you cannot stop, and so your brain keeps paying attention because your brain loves scary things. So in sense, make paying attention to your breathing as boring as possible. Set alarms throughout the day to remind you to pay attention to your breathing - seems counter intuitive, but WOW does it actually work.
Read as much literature as you can from well reputed sources on health anxiety and panic attacks. I recommend especially D.A.R.E, but I would also simply recommend watching this short video. I also used an anxiety/phobia/panic attack workbook that helped a lot, although I cannot remember the name of it now.
Never, EVER google symptoms. Ever. Not because you should be scared by what you find, because you shouldn't, but because you aren't smart enough to recognize that you shouldn't be scared. If everyone could take their findings with a grain of salt and recognize that they have no idea what they are doing and should draw no conclusions from what they find, there would be no issue. But everyone thinks of themselves as smart and competent, and so they think they are likely to come up with accurate conclusions. WRONG. Even people who know the relevant biology and anatomy can't properly dissect a medical journal - and you think you can do it as a layman? Doctors understand things about frequencies and qualifying characteristics for diagnoses that none of us will ever understand and can't be found in a quick google search. Please leave anything medically related up to the professionals at all times.
Considering taking a calcium + magnesium + zinc supplement. Recommended by many resources for dealing with anxiety.
You should probably quit caffeine. I was the biggest coffee head you can imagine, and even though I was forced to quit by an extreme sensitivity to caffeine I developed, I probably would of quit anyway. Life is much better without it anyways - it's hard to imagine why I ever needed it in the first place at this point. Now I just wake up and feel great, not like i need a cup of coffee immediately. Copious amounts of decaf satisfy my requirements for the taste of black coffee.

Let's think about our ancestors. Let's think about the harsh conditions - weather, starvation, injury, lack of medicine, lack of clean water - that the cavemen endured. Let's think about these same harsh conditions that millions of humans still endure today in undeveloped nations. Let's think about the incredible survival stories we've all heard - someone surviving in the wilderness for years, someone surviving a horrible animal attack or car accident or plane crash, someone overcoming a terminal illness. 
When we sit around in our clean, tidy, organized first-world countries, it's easy to forget what generations upon generations of humans have gone through to get us to this point. The human body has adapted and evolved to be able to survive some of the harshest conditions on this planet. Extreme heat, extreme cold, starvation, dehydration, infection, broken bones, open wounds. It is an incredibly intelligent machine, with hundreds of built-in mechanisms to course-correct if something is thrown off-balance. And most of us have such advantages today as access to clean water, consistent food, and medical care, which haven't been readily available for the majority of human existence.
So no, that paper cut isn't going to give you sepsis. That drop of blood on the toilet paper isn't going to be your end. That headache isn't a tumor or a stroke or an aneurysm. A bout of food poisoning isn't going to kill you. Breathing in some smoke or fumes isn't going to cause permanent damage. A fast heart rate isn't a heart attack. That acid reflux isn't esophageal cancer. It starts to sound silly the more you think about it.
Next time you are worried about a symptom, remember just how strong you really are. Remember how much the human body can survive. Remember that you are equipped with the same incredible biological machinery as generations before you, who endured far worse than you ever will.",413,Create an account,https://old.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/dkljd7/your_body_is_strong_resilient_and_the_product_of/,,,,,1,343,62.82,80.12,47.56,11.35,15.59,9.04,4.08,4.96,0.87,0.29,0.29,0.29,0,0,0,10.79,1.46,0.29,0,0.58,0,0.29,9.33,0.29,0,0,0,1.46,0.29,0,1.17,0.58,0,0,0.58,0,0,8.45,4.66,3.21,0,0,0,0,1.17,0.29,0.58,0.29,0.58,1.46,0,0,6.12,2.92,7.58,2.62,19.53,6.41,7,0,0,4.08,2.04,0

I know it’s all in my head, because when I’m distracted it goes away and I feel perfectly fine. But, I seem to be very aware of all my body sensations. For example, everyone’s body moves slightly as they take a breath in and out. But because I’m moving slightly, I associate this with being dizzy or off balance, which sets off my anxiety and I spiral and begin to panic.

A bit of backstory:
I’ve had heart palpitations on and off since 2015, they began a few months before I had to move countries on my own for university and leave everything and everyone behind. 
For my palpitations, they always felt more like a sinking feeling. I could best describe it as: 

when you’re in one of those slow moving elevators and it’s the feeling you get in your stomach/chest when the elevator stops agonisingly slowly. I know, very specific.
when a plane first lifts off and you can feel it in your whole body that you’re suddenly no longer touching the ground.
when something jumps in front of you and your heart “sinks in your stomach”.

So you can guess I had a fun time explaining the above feelings to not one or two doctors. The looks I’ve got were amazing. 
After being checked by multiple doctors in two countries, they never ever found anything. Blood tests, ambulance called, EKG, more recently an X-RAY . Pretty sure the only thing I haven’t had was a 24hour heart monitor, because as I’m 22 and doctors never found anything, no one was concerned enough to set me up with one. 
My mom always calms me down with ""one doctor could be mistaken, but 7+ can't all make the same mistake so you just gotta trust them!""
A few months ago I had a full week of palpitations. Seven days exactly. And they stopped just as sudden as they started. One day I was fine, the other day I was having a palpitation every few minutes and in seven days they stopped. I went to the emergency room as I was having a palpitation literally every 4-5 minutes, sometimes more. And a few things happened at the emergency:

I had a palpitation while connected to a heart monitor.
The doctor could not see it when checking the printout version of my heart rhythm. (not sure of the proper naming of it, but it’s that long piece of paper with your heart rhythm on it) 

I was amazed, how could I have a palpitation and for it to not be visible? 
As it turns out, women can have palpitations based on hormone activity that are considered so tiny and so normal that are basically not detected by heart monitors, but if the woman is highly sensitive or suffering from health anxiety she’s more prone to feeling it. Imagine feeling a palpitation when even ECG cannot recognise it as such. 
So I just wanted to share some things and possibly help:

Heart palpitations in women can very often be a hormone change such as period, ovulation or sometimes as simple as pms. 
As everyone has said before, caffeine is a big no if you’re suffering from palpitations. But also chocolate and foods high in sugar. If I’m having palpitations and I’ve been eating too much sugar I take it as my body saying stop it now. 
W A T E R. I cannot possibly stress it enough! The amount of palpitations I’ve had that were solely because I was dehydrated.... I always carry a water bottle with me now and when I’m experiencing palpitations I drink even more than usual because it makes not only my heart but my body work better.
Being too hot can also cause palpitations - after a hot shower or wearing too much clothes.
The Vagus Nerve. Its a nerve connecting your stomach and your brain that passes right next to the heart and can cause palpitations if the stomach is dealing with overeating, too heavy food, too spicy etc. This video explains it in detail -> https://youtu.be/yvJ7KNIgGQ4
And most importantly - If it causes you panic - ITS NOT A   HEART ATTACK. I’ve spoken with quite a few people that has survived heart attacks and they all said the same - they were not panicking when it happened. They were worried but their bodies literally could not panic as it was a life and death situation and they had to be sane enough to reach for help and survive. So if you panic, it’s just a sign it’s safe and you’ll be fine.

Hope all of this helps at least a bit. You’re not alone and it’s gonna be okay ❤️

I went to the 18472828473819385382919475th page of google so YOU didnt have to. 
For starters, I am NOT a doctor or scientist or a smart person by any means I am just a fellow health anxiety sufferer who combats her health anxiety with facts & stats and would like to share her findings with all of you beautiful people. 
I will not be linking anything because...Ive opened every link out there okay. Every link. Every pdf. Every news article. Every Wikipedia page. There would be waaaaay too many. 
You CAN look this stuff up yourself and I do encourage it if you are confident you will not trigger yourself and end up in the ER.
✨ SO ✨
Without further ado, lets get into it.
Animals that can carry & transmit the rabies virus: 
- Dogs
- Cats
- Bats
- Foxes
- Skunks
- Racoons.
I will not be covering foxes, skunks, and raccoons, because I would HOPE you know to go get checked out if one of those motherfuckers rips a hole in your skin & thats that.
How does one get rabies? 
The answer:
Through the bite or scratch of an infected animal showing clinical symptoms.
1 very important thing I need you to notice in that sentence. 
it has to be showing clinical symptoms.
That means its drooling, foaming at the mouth, it can barely walk, its extremely aggressive for no reason and literally going out of its way to fucking attack you.
You can watch a video on youtube if you can bear it of a poor kitty infected with it. That will give you an idea of what these animals will look like when showing clinical symptoms.
It then, when showing clinical symptoms will have to bite or scratch you HARD ENOUGH TO DRAW BLOOD (read that twice. It can literally bite or scratch you with rabies but if it doesnt draw blood youre safe.) or it will need to directly spit or drool into your mucous membranes or an open wound.
First biggest stat you need to know - rabies is even more rare to be contracted by scratch or any other way that isnt a bite. In fact its almost unheard of. I read about 2 cases total of someone being scratched and developing rabies. The reason this is - is because the animal would have to lick its claws right before scratching you. Understood?
MOVING ON.
Rabies is contracted 99% of the time through dogs or cats.
Im sure that little stat just scared the hell out of you, but dont let it. Heres why. 
The reason that number is so high, is because we come into contact most with dogs & cats. 
Also keep in mind rabies is extremely super duper rare, and that 99% is only the extremely few cases that have happened. So dont hear that percentage and flip because thats a statistic of like what - maybe 20 cases that have happened since the 1950s?
And now for the most relieving piece of information about dogs & cats with rabies. 
Thanks to strict vaccination laws - rabies in our domesticated furry little friends is almost out of the question.
All cats and dogs must be vaccinated I believe at 3 weeks of age, and then again at 1 year and every 3 years after that.
BUT did you know a scientist recently did a study on how long these vaccinations can truly last in these animals by injecting them with the rabies virus and seen how they held up. Here are his findings:
(This study was just in dogs but it was said it would work for cats too!)
Dogs infected with the rabies virus that were ✨a year late✨ on vaccinations: 100% protected, showed no symptoms whatsoever. 
Dogs infected with the rabies virus ✨3 years late✨ for vaccinations: 100% were completely protected. No signs of rabies were shown.
Dogs infected with the rabies virus ✨5 years late✨ for vaccinations: 100% were completely protected. No signs of rabies were shown.
Anything after 5 years began to drop. First to 90% all the way down to 50%. Vets are even rallying together to change the vaccination updates to every 5 years to save the pet owners some money!!! It lasts these little guys longer than we thought! How awesome!
Im going to move on from dogs and cats now - but first if youre not completely reassured - look up the last dog or cat who had rabies in your state. Read up on if that animal even had contact with a human. In my case, it didnt. And theres been no dog in my state who has tested positive since the 1950s. SINCE THE 1950s. Im assuming this holds true for the lot of you as well! 
Anyways, lets move onto ✨bats✨
Now.
I know looottts about bats, because they are predominantly the ones I worry about transmitting it to me, even though this fear is completely & totally irrational.
You'll see why after I present all the facts.
First stat you need to know - 1% of all bats have rabies.
One. Measly. Percent.
There was a study done by a man whos been studying bats for 55 years in Texas. 
This man literally walks into caves and into bat infested areas looking to study bats.
Bats have flown into his face, chest, neck, bare arms & legs, literally hitting him all over.
And in 55 years, he never got bit or scratched.
Care to know why? I bet you do.
Bats, are extremely scared of humans. Literally terrified. Why? Because we're the reason theyre dying and going endangered in record numbers. Weve given them something called white nose syndrome from disrupting their caves and roost sites. Multitudes of bats are dying from this little known disease - not rabies. They will literally do anything in their power to get away from us. They are not creatures of violence. A bat will NEVER go out of its way to attack you. even rapid. 
If you want - look up human cases of rabies caused by bats. Youll notice a few things. 

Over half of them were caused by people picking them up. 
The other half happened when the bat was in the persons house while the person slept - AND THE PERSON KNEW THEY WERE BIT AND CHOSE NOT TO SEEK TREATMENT.
4 of those cases were literally organ transplants of a bat variant of rabies. YALL. 🤦🤦🤦

So the 2 things I want you to remember - if you didnt pick up a bat, youre chances of rabies decreases to almost 0%. 
2, if you wake up to a bat in your room - you still may not have rabies. Observe how the bat is acting. Rapid or no? Then, Inspect yourself for bite marks. Call the hospital & ask for guidance on if you need the antivirus or not. Call local animal control to remove the bat and have it tested for the virus. They will call you with the results.
And on the topic of bat bites.
Im sure youve all heard the giant fucking ✨MYTH✨ that you cant feel a bat bite. It has been reported NUMEROUS times to feel like 2 HYPODERMIC FUCKING NEEDLES ENTERING YOUR SKIN. It will also NOTICEABLY draw blood and you CAN notice the scar after it heals. Dont listen to that nonsense about ""you wont even know"" its just fear mongerers trying to get their money off that 10,000 dollar anti virus you got because they preyed on your HA. 
Legit even the people bit in their sleep FOUND the bite mark the next morning. You would have to. It HAS TO GET NASTY AND INFECTED PEOPLE. IT CANT JUST DISAPPEAR ITS GONNA GET ALL GROSS AND SLIMY AND WEIRDLY COLORED. Its actually the number one symptom AFTER the inital contact with a rapid animal, and that INCLUDES bats. It will itch, it will hurt, it will show signs of infection.
Anyway.
BACK TO THE TEXAS BAT LAD. )
In Austin Texas, they released over 1 million bats to actually test & see if it would increase cases of rabies. Texas bat lad was apart of this study.
Not a single case was reported in humans. 
And out of a million only a handful A HANDDDFULLLLL of bats tested positive. 
I cant remember the exact numbers, but it was in the low hundreds out of over a million.
Texas bat lad who again has 55 years of being around bats under his belt, says there is never any real threat AT ALL unless youre going around picking up bats.
So what have we learned? DO NOT PICK UP BATS. EVEN THOUGH LESS THAN 1% CARRY THE VIRUS. DONT. FUCKING. DO IT.
Heres some facts about bats with rabies.

I said this earlier, but its good to remember. They will never go out of their way to attack you. They are terrified of you. Even rapid, they will be trying to get the fuck away from you. 
When bats have rabies, they become EXTREMELY lethargic. Theyre so small and its already so much work for the little guys to fly. This disease tires them out completely. You probably wont ever even see one with rabies because they like to go somewhere and hide out until they unfortunately die of it. Poor babies. ❤
Even though less than 1% of bats have rabies, and the chances of them EVER transmitting that to you is incredibly low, here are the symptoms presented in bats with rabies: spending lots of time on the ground, out at daytime, will not care if you disturb him, walking around instead of flying, if it is able to fly, it will literally be moreso jumping a little ways into the air and erractily flapping its wings only to fall to the ground, loud hissing and screeching over and over and over and over and over. Like rage screeching okay.

And now for the most extensive work I did, hope this comes through for someone. 
I literally researched the bats that were most common to transmit rabies.
Here you are.
The Silver Haired Bat: transmitted it to humans 16 times.
The Hoary Bat: transmitted it to humans 11 times.
Little/Big Brown Bat: 2 or 3 times between the two.
Theres more, but it was also 1 or 2 times. The reason I included little & big brown is because they are the most commonly seen bat!!! 
Well, Big Brown is the most commonly seen I mean.
Chances are you've seen one. Almost all the other bats are extremely endangered by white nose syndrome.
Hes the most commonly seen bat EVER and hes only transmitted it 2 or 3 times, possibly 1. We dont know. In fact I tried to find the cases that included big brown, but, it happened so long ago I cant.
So the bat youve probably spiraled about before? Was him. And he posed no risk at all. 
Hes also the most frequently tested bat for rabies (because hes so common) and over all the THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS SENT IN, only 3.8% had rabies. Thats 1 in 25, folks. 
Hes also adorable & furry do look him up. ☺
✨ALRIGHT✨
Now that Ive covered the animals.
Lets cover rabies itself. 
Here are the facts.

Rabies has the same rarity as winning the lottery. Youd win the lottery before you got rabies. 
Rabies is 100% curable before clinical symptoms show. Clinical symptoms are: dehydration, aversion to water, drooling, paralysis, not eating. CLINICAL SYMPTOMS ARE NOT THESE SYMPTOMS THAT ALSO PRESENT WITH RABIES: fever, sore throat, rash at the bite wound, headache, fatigue, nausea, general discomfort. DO YOU ALL KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS??? If you are worried you are exposed, and show ANY of the last symptoms I mentioned, you are still 100% in the clear & can go promptly be seen. Those signs are not clinical, meaning the virus has not made it to the brain yet.
Rabies ✨IS NOT✨ 100% fatal like you were told. 14 people have lived AFTER showing clinical symptoms. Thats still low but you know what else that means? ✨ YOUR CHANCES OF SURVIVING RABIES ARE HIGHER THAN YOUR CHANCES OF EVER GETTING RABIES✨ 
Of the 14 people who survived - half were put into a coma that allowed the body to trick the virus into thinking the host had died. Except one little girl who LITERALLY FUCKING KILLED ✨RABIES✨ with good old hydrogen peroxide. She picked up a bat, it bit her, her mom immediately ✨DOUSED✨ that open wound with peroxide, collected the bat, and sent it in for testing. It tested positive, they quarantined the girl, she never showed one damn symptom. What Im saying is - if you ever get bit, DOUSE THAT BITCH IN PEROXIDE.
About 100,000 people get the rabies antivirus shots every year. About 1 or 3 of them really even needed it - because they more than likely werent exposed because its so damn rare.

I think that about covers it!!! 
I hope I remembered everything. If anyone leaves a question or something down below Ill probably remember and comment with more facts I forgot to include up here.
I apologize for my scatter brain and truly hope someone was able to gain something from reading this, let me know if it helped any of you, and sorry for the length!!!

37,2021-09-01T21:15:11+00:00,Next_Winter,Eye twitching finally gone after 2 1/2 months,"Hi! 
I had an eye twitch for 2 1/2 months that wouldn't go away and that was actually getting worst week after week. The twitch had also started spreading to other places on my face, but in less intensity, like on my other eye and my lips.
While I had the twitches, I've googled a lot and became anxious of rare diseases like BEB (benign essential blepharospasms), multiple sclerosis or als.
There wasn't lot of infos on reddit about eye twitching lasting more than a month, so that's why I wanna make this post. 
Most of the posts I've read on reddit and most of the infos on google recommended to sleep more, reduce eye strain, drink less caffeine, take potassium, take magnesium, drink less alcohol, smoke less, use hydrating eye's drops and reduce stress.
I tried most of those things after the first 3 days of my eye twitching: I started eating bananas and taking potassium and magnesium pills daily, use eye drops twice daily, stop drinking coffee and avoid being on the computer or on my phone. 
I've give up on those things after around a week, because it wasn't helping and my twitches was getting worst, so I stop the pills-bananas-eyedrops and re-started drinking coffee and using my computer and phone normally again. I don't usually smoke nor drink alcohol except on very, very rare occasions (like, 3-4x/year), and I was already sleeping 7-8hrs/night, so those recommandations didn't apply to me. 
So long story short, I've been on vacations from work for the last 1 1/2 week, and my twitches went away after the first 2-3 days off work. So even though I wasn't feeling tired nor stressed, I guess I was, and the twitches was probably just my body trying to tell me I was more stressed than I thought. I'm just hoping now the twitches won't come back when I go back to work next week!
So that's it, I just wanna described my experience if someone else is going through something similar. If you have eye twitches for months and potassium/eyedrops/magnesium/stop-drinking-coffee isn't working, it doesn't mean you have MS or BEB or something's else. It may just go away on it owns after some time.

I just want to say that our bodies are very different and some gets lumps everywhere like up to 100s and some get less. And many won’t even notice they have many lumps/lump cause they aren’t as scared like many of us. 
If you can move your lump around and it’s squishy/rubbery it’s a very good indicator that its bengin and just fatty tissue. But if this isn’t the case for you then still it can be so many other things that causes this so don’t jump into conclusions just go to your dermatologist! Either way any new bumps/lumps should be checked but they will most likely be harmless! 
I myself found 3 lumps around my ribcage and that’s what made my HA very very bad to the point I couldn’t sleep or eat. Something that really helped me was a subreddit called r/Lipoma and there you can find many that have the same situation and it really calmed me down! 
I did mess with my lumps a lot so they got sore which I advice you to not do cause that just causes more anxiety. I even got bruises! 
I want to add that these fatty lumps can grow anywhere on your body! They have no boundaries and they can be big and small. (Legs, arms, torso, groin, head, etc.)
I know that a post like this would’ve really helped me so I wanted to share this traumatic journey I had and transfer it into something good!

She refused and was like ""nah, thatll make it sting.""
I say - well what if it gets infected what if something serious happens?
""Doctors go to school for that. Ill be fine.""
No one but me was even remotely concerned.
I watched my nieces run around and literally SLAM their heads into walls and hard floors and shit, & get up and carry on laughing and having a time. And I mean they slam it hard enough the sit up dazed from it.
I panic and rush them over to their parents who are like ""did much worse at that age. Theyre fine."" 
OR, I AM COMPLETELY DISREGARDED BY THEM.
Then, I think the most astonishing thing that happened this week, my sister in laws 1 & 2 year old got into some room fragrance pellets AND ATE SOME OF THE MOTHERFUCKING PELLETS. 
My mind is SPIRALING like OH MY GOD GET POISON CONTROL ON THE PHONE WE HAVE MINUTES MERE MINUTES PEOPLE HOSPITAL NOW LETS GO LETS GO GET A MOVE ON.
I rush the babies to their mom, hand her the pellets, and inform her the babies had eaten some. 
SHE LAUGHED.
AND SAID THAT WASNT THE WORST THING THEYVE EATEN.
AND THAT WAS THAT.
IT IS LITERAL HHOOOUUURRSSS AFTER THAT INCIDENT AND THEYRE FINE.
I am BAFFLED. 
And, Ive gained a little more respect for the human bodies durability. 
Ive watched this family do some crazy shit yall. This is only the stuff Ive observed this week. You wouldn't believe the stories I have about the time I went to the ocean with them. Every one of them was stung by a jellyfish or bitten by something while in the water - and not one person sought treatment and carried on like it didn't happen. The 1 & 2 year old ate a bucket of sand. A whole fucking bucket. My sister in laws husband got in a motorcycle reck and flew off his bike under another car. He was unconscious when they got to him. He had to have surgery and was released within a few days. 
My fiance swam in the high tide area WAY past the safe limit. He had fish jumping over his head at one point.
Where can I get this energy??? WHY AM I AFRAID ALL THE TIME???? WHY CANT I LIVE WITH NO REGARD FOR MY SAFETY LIKE THIS????

42,2019-10-22T18:43:30+00:00,Poluhh,Good reminders for the week,"Hey there, just wanted to pass by and remind you guys of a few things:

Exercising will make your heart rate go up, it's normal. Climbing stairs, having sex, walking, even standing up in a bus can make you feel tired and give you muscle pain (if you aren't used to exercise). Don't stop exercising because of those symptoms, you're supposed to feel them at first and it's more natural to the body if you exercise than if you don't (unless you have a debilitating disease which is rare and still can exercise with medical monitoring).
Headaches can be caused by lack of sleep, too much sleep, not drinking enough water, clenching your teeth, alcohol, too much noise or bright lights and anxiety.
Speaking of anxiety, it can give you so many symptoms there are lists on the internet to check them. But since googling is not very nice for people here, I'll give you some: rapid heartbeats, cold on body extremities, palpitation, trembling hands, dizziness, sensation of tingling or numbness, wish to cry or run away, twitching, stomach pains, diarrhea or constipation, bloating, restless legs... The list goes on.
If you took a vaccine and your arm feels warm and kind of swollen, that's a normal reaction. Feeling some cold symptoms too. Also some vaccines last for 10 years, so if you've taken the tetanus one (for example) five years ago, don't worry about tetanus.
It's not that easy to catch HIV. You don't catch it by oral sex. You don't catch it by wearing condoms. If you take a lot of tests afterwards on the right time and they come all negative, you don't have it. Those kind of tests are more reliable than symptoms.
Tetanus doesn't just come from rusty things, you'd have to get a really deep cut to get it. Brain eating bacteria is extremely rare and won't be on your tap water. Throwing up is a natural response and means your body is fighting something bad, don't force yourself to stop it. You need to be penetrated without a protection to get pregnant, periods can be irregular. Some paint or fume won't give you problems or kill you. 
Cats and dogs who have their vaccines and anti fungicide and live inside houses won't give you anything. Scratches hurt and they're supposed to get a bit swollen afterwards. 
After getting a cold or the flu, you will feel tired. Your body was combating something, you are supposed to feel a bit tired afterwards. Just remember to keep yourself hydrated, to rest and eat something simple!
Your body isn't perfect, and our diets aren't either. Sometimes your poop will be different. Medicine, recovering from an infection, different foods, stress and lack of water can change the shape and color of it. Just remember to eat as well as possible, because your intestine is your ""second brain"", as in it will help you combat against anxiety or depression.
You can't control someone else's life. I'm sorry, but as much as you worry about them, you can't watch them every minute of their day. It won't stop them from getting hurt or sick. The best way to deal with anxiety for others is simply helping them emotionally as much as they need and go to therapy yourself.
Google will give you terrible diseases for your symptoms because it has to and it wants you to keep searching for things. Trust doctors. Trust the data, some diseases (mainly neurological) are extremely rare and googling it won't solve anything. Everytime you feel the need to be reassured, try instead helping someone here by replying to some posts, going for a walk, focusing on things you see around you or talk to someone anything other than health issues.
Also try avoiding sugary drinks, and if your birth control pills aren't working/giving you bad symptoms for a while, go to a gynecologist to change them.
By washing your hands, cleaning your vegetables, eating well, having good hygiene, exercising, going to the ophthalmologist once a year (or once every two years), having protected sex and sleeping well, you will be avoiding most sickness you can. Seriously, you're doing way more than most people in the world. And even without those people live a lot. So will you.

So remember: you can be afraid of getting hit by a car and look at both sides to cross the street to avoid it. But don't be so afraid that it stops you from crossing it at all. Connect with your family, talk to your friends, try to look out for therapy, party, study, but please, don't let HA eat you alive. Don't stop doing things because you're afraid of getting sick. Do whatever you can to escape it, as hard as it is.
And remember, progress isn't linear, and that's okay.

The one who constantly googles symptoms and convinces and diagnose themselves with illness like heart disease, cancer, pulmonary embolisms, MS, brain tumors etc etc etc. The one who goes to ERs and doctors because they’ve thrown themselves into such a vicious cycle of overwhelming anxiety and panic they start to feel psychosomatic symptoms that miming what their brain convinces them they have, only to be told it’s just anxiety and all your tests come back normal. The one who isn’t living their life because they are so sure they are going to drop dead at any moment. 
I’m saying all of this because I was that person, and sometimes, still am that person. I’ve been dealing with anxiety, and more specifically health anxiety for the better of 2-3 years now on and off. For the longest time I was convinced I had everything from all the illnesses I listed above and then some. Fast heart rate? Heart disease/heart attack. Air hunger? Pulmonary embolism or lung cancer. Tingling feelings? MS. Migraines/sinus headaches? Brain cancer. I’ve been through it all. I know what it’s like to sit there with the feeling of doom and having my brain cycle over and over again with everything I could possibly have.
If it’s one thing I’ve learned after my last ER visits is the power of the mind. For months I was dealing with air hunger, not getting a satisfied breath when inhaling so I would constantly take deep breaths trying to get that satisfied feeling. The more I did that the worse it got. I ended up going to the ER, AGAIN, for the 10th time in the last few years only to get normal results AGAIN. From that day I told myself that I will no longer be a victim to my intrusive thoughts and trust the results. And I’m not going to sit here and say I’ve cured myself, not by a long-shot, but with practice and STAYING OFF THE INTERNET I’ve noticed 80% of all my health worries have disappeared. 
If you’ve been checked by a doctor/specialist, believe your results, if you have doubt get a second opinion. But once you do, SNAP OUT OF IT. I am NOT a doctor, but after being checked from head to toe more times over the last few years than most people do in their whole life I said enough is enough. What’s the point of letting life pass by just anticipating an illness? None.

53,2021-07-05T11:53:30+00:00,Alone_Biscotti9494,My Colon Cancer Scare Experience,"Hi to everyone. It's 6:30 in the evening, and I just got home. Really tired but I'm here to share my experience.
Earlier today I went in for a colonoscopy. This is perhaps the longest day of my life. Every hour since starting the prep felt like ages. I spent the entire night before researching my symptoms, reading stories online, and overthinking like I always do. 
I knew it wouldn't change anything, but maybe I was looking for some sort of assurance.
For the past year I've been having:
​

streaks of blood in stool
lots of mucus in stool
gradual thinning of stools
alternating diarrhea and constipation
rectal pressure (feels like I'm sitting on a marble)
incomplete bowel movement
occasional abdominal cramping
fatigue (I used to easily run 5 miles without stopping but now at 2 miles I'm short of breath)
weight loss (15 pounds in around five months)
bloodwork showed slightly low iron (normal hemoglobin) & slightly elevated liver enzymes (thought it spread)
CT scan showed fatty liver (but I was worried it was a misdiagnosed liver metastases)

All these symptoms gradually got worse in the course of a year that I eventually pushed for a colonoscopy. As someone with health anxiety, the only thing that assured me was that I was young (23). 
But after reading so many horror stories of young people like me getting cancer at later stages because they were dismissed, I didn't take any second chances.
Anyway, colonoscopy was a breeze. Doc didn't find any polyp, but there was mild inflammation in my rectum and sigmoid colon, causing my GI symptoms. The others were attributed to stress and anxiety, especially the weight loss. The diagnosis was called proctosigmoiditis. I was prescribed some antibiotics. She did say it kind of increases my risks of developing CRC, so I will have to get a colonoscopy every 3-5 years for prevention.
I was really convinced that I had cancer. There was no way stress would be producing blood in my stool or skewing my bloodwork.
But then again, I'm thankful it's not. I haven't been eating healthy ever since so I guess this is a wake up call for me to change my lifestyle. I take this as a second chance.
And to fellow young people like me worrying about their symptoms, I highly suggest pushing for a colonoscopy. Stop googling. Stop convincing yourself without a proper diagnosis and procedures to investigate your case. I spent a year getting anxious and convincing myself I was late-stage over my symptoms.

54,2021-02-20T14:56:01+00:00,magicxxmoon,I'm out ✌️,"Ive decided this morning I'm done with health anxiety. 
I'm ruining my life little by little day by day. 
I'm taking my life back starting today.
I miss planning for the future and enjoying each moment I am blessed to have experienced. I miss laughing. I miss being present in conversations. I miss my hobbies and passions. Hell, I miss TV. I miss enjoying my food. I miss my clean house and having pride in myself. I miss wanting to look nice, and wanting to take care of myself. I miss leaving the house.
Health Anxiety is miserable and I'm done giving in to it. 
It's taken way to much from me. 
Not anymore.
Life is short, as we all know. It's short and we obsess over our health because it's short.
This is no way to spend it. 
You're not promised the next moment. That's difficult to think about but it's true. If that made you uncomfy remember this: most people live comfortably into their nineties happy and content with a lifetime of memories made.
Your body is resilient and able to naturally respond to any ailments youre concerned about right now. Having health anxiety is not saving you. It's not protecting you. Your body does that. You don't have to. 
Quit your health anxiety and recover today. Now. Take your life back. Start over. Make plans. Fall in love with living again.
Never forget your struggles with health anxiety are valid. You are never alone. And you are loved. ❤️

Brain tumors cause seizures and such things, and they do not get better, than worse than better again. So if you’re having a headache, or anything of the sorts, and it goes away after a while and then comes back it’s almost certainly allergies, or tension headache from your stressing. Headaches are extremely common for people especially as the seasons change, so your headache last week is probably just a normal boring old headache. Sleep well and next time breath, take some pain meds and rest. Also only 32% of tumors in the brain are cancerous. So decreasing the odds of it being cancer even more. But again a simple headache does not mean tumor. Stressing will only cause more sharp and intense headaches. God bless

MORE FRIENDLY REMINDERS:
Panic attacks cannot kill you!
It is extremely unlikely that you have that disease you just heard about! More likely, your mind is tricking you into experiencing the symptoms that you fear!
Asking for reassurance may reinforce your anxiety, so it’s better to try to distract yourself instead!
MOST IMPORTANTLY, there exists help for health anxiety! You do not have to live with this forever!

Drink less stimulants or depressants. Yes, put down the coffee in the morning and alcohol at night. Get through the withdrawal, it’s coming.
Drink more water.
Give whatever symptom you’re having 5 entire days before you start rushing to Google. Your body does weird things. So does mine. So does everyone else’s. My left hand literally went numb while typing this, I laughed and ignored it... now it’s fine. I forgot I was gripping my steering wheel and singing in the car. Oh, and I’m drinking coffee. Damnit. See #3. (Obviously don’t wait 5 days on a broken arm. IANAD and none of this is medical advice.)
When you start to panic, go for a walk or light jog. Don’t paralyze your being into your phone. Whatever you’re used to doing, surprise your body by doing something else. Don’t go in the bathroom, sit on the toilet, Google your symptoms, and leave feeling weak-minded. (Anyone relate?) Do something different.

Repetition is key. Look at your anxiety like a muscle (cuz that’s what our brains are). You have reps and sets to become stronger, right? Same thing for anxiety. The weight will feel heavy and you’ll tremble. Hell, you may even drop the weight. But the more you lift it, the stronger you get and the lighter it feels. 
Remind yourself that you’ve gotten through x,y,z before. Remind yourself that panic attacks don’t last. Remind yourself of anything a doctor or someone close ever said that has brought you relief. 
Our brain became trained to be on high alert. It can be trained to monitor without fear. Feeling better doesn’t mean you’re not paying attention or being vigilant. 
As always - easier said than done. However, it can become easier the more you try.

Do not live your life afraid. 
I have been living in fear of the next bad thing since my father had a blood clot in his brain years ago. He survived. He is fine. But I am constantly looking for the next disaster. 
I assume I have breast cancer even though I don’t feel anything alarming in my own self checks, and go in for a yearly check by a gynecologist. I assume my headaches are tumors even though I know I haven’t had enough water that day or didn’t sleep and that brought on the migraine. I assume even though my whole family has, thankfully, been vaccinated against COVID I still need to be scared to do something as simple as eat in a restaurant. 
For myself and everyone like me, this is your message to stop living your life in fear of the next bad thing. 
The odds of having any of the dozens of horrible things we think of each day are so, so low. The odds of the smallest twinge in your chest being a heart attack are nearly nonexistent. The odds of your floaters being a brain tumor are minuscule. The odds of your bowel issues being anything other than stress related are laughable. 
I have been afraid of all of these things for years. I’ve let them control me and my mood and my enjoyment of my life, and I’ve lurked this sub long enough to know I am not alone. 
The internet will only give you horror stories. You’ll never find an article about the woman who worried herself sick over the lump she wasn’t even sure she felt in her breast, went to the doctor, and got told everything was fine. You’ll never hear the stories about the 26 year old who went in for a colonoscopy because the pandemic and all the anxiety it brought with it destroyed their digestive system but that most definitely didn’t have colon cancer. You only hear about the absolute worst case scenarios online, but those are the outliers that are only used as scare tactics for online traffic. 
This post is a reminder to myself as well as anyone else lurking, searching for that one post to put your mind at ease.

71,2020-07-03T23:21:14+00:00,letmegapeurgirl,8 year HA sufferer/survivor here with some very simple tips,"The title... as simple and straight to the point as I can get.
​
I've had this condition since I was around 18. A random pain in my head waiting for a bus with my girlfriend instantly triggered what we know as HA. I then found a lump on my testicle New Years Day 2012 and wow did that really mess me up. 
​
I also experience weed induced panic attacks which then boil over into HA and I would never wish that psychological torture on my worst enemy, EVER! 
​
However, I have found things after being ignorant of them which can really inflate the chances of anxiety attacks. 
​
1.) Caffeine. Stay AWAY from Caffeine if you are prone to daily HA attacks. (Personally talking, having one cup of tea in the morning I find is okay, FOR ME!) 
2.) Don't shy away from talking about it with friends. Talking about it, I've found, is like drawing your sword to the enemy and pushing it further away each time we talk about. Listening to peoples rational responses should help cement your own rational thoughts.
3.) HA has been documented to cause all sorts of psycho-somatic symptoms, to save you the hassle of Googling, it's a psychological condition/response or even disturbance where the mind creates physical pain due to thinking there has been pain there for a considerate amount of time, as such, we have a little cramp in our belly, leg, head, behind the eyes, etc, we will start concentrating on that area more and more, causing a bias confirmation that there is something wrong (I think you MAY have to Google psychosomatica as it is very interesting) 
4.) The mind wanders when it has nothing to do, every time you're aware you're having irrational thoughts, re-direct those thoughts/energy into doing something physical, like reading, walking, meditation and yoga are all extremely forgotten medicines that have been proven to heal the soul and calm the mind. 
5.) Do not waste your time worrying about what may or may not take you from this earth, with the time we have here. Use the anxiety as a trigger to remind yourself it is taking your literal life away, and the last thing we want to do is being alive and not actually living. 
6.) Take up mind stimulating games, such as chess, sudoku, learn an instrument - I've found that indulging in learning a second language, my mind has no time to remind me of the HA I have, a very helpful tool in forgetting there is ever a problem. 
7.) Realize that happiness is free, and it's the only thing we take for granted. 
​
I hope this very non-orthodox way of looking and explaining my experience can help others who think they are the only unique ones who feel the way they do, we all feel the same way about the fear, where that fear stems from could be different areas, but looking at that fear head on can also be the strongest tool we utilize. 
​
Hope everyone is feeling okay while reading this and understand YOU ARE NOT ALONE! This is becoming more and more of a global pandemic than the current pandemic, and is frustratingly never ever shown in MSM or practices in general.",195,Create an account,https://old.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/hkt5s4/8_year_ha_sufferersurvivor_here_with_some_very/,,,,,1,555,38.12,48.62,75.84,7.34,19.82,7.39,2.88,4.32,3.42,0.72,2.52,1.44,0.18,0,0,10.45,4.5,1.08,0,0.9,0.36,1.08,6.13,0,0.36,0.18,0,0.36,0,0,0.36,1.44,0.72,0,0.54,0,0.18,4.86,2.52,0.9,0.54,0.36,0.36,0.18,0.54,0,0.36,0.72,0.9,0,0,0,5.23,2.7,6.13,1.62,16.04,4.86,5.95,0,0.54,1.44,3.24,0

A circle of going doctors, running tests, and fear of misdiagnosis.
One thing I want to speak on (26F perspective), I never spoke to my bf about marriage or even talked about our future. Mainly because I am so scared that something will happen and I just won’t make it that far. That concludes me always living day by day and not being financially/mentally prepared as an “adult”. Having this mentality makes me break down so much. Every time I think about the future I just think why am I putting in so much effort if it might not even happen.

I actually went to the doctor and got blood work done!,"Longtime HA sufferer here, but unlike some, I actually struggle with the idea of seeing a doctor at all, as opposed to wanting frequent tests, exams, etc. I'm 31 now, but I haven't visited a doctor since I was probably a teenager. Every time I would worry about a symptom, someone would always tell me to make a doctors appointment, and every time, I chickened out. I was always so scared of receiving bad news. The past year especially, I've spend untold amounts of time working up the nerve to finally visit a doctor for a routine physical and blood work.
But this week, I was finally able to do it! It took some serious balls of steel for me, and I almost canceled my appointments several times, but I kept it together and got a blood test and physical. When my doctor measured my pulse, she almost couldn't believe how high it was (~150 bpm), and I had to explain how scared I was. But, at the end, she told me I had a clean bill of health, and suddenly SO much anxiety that had weighed on me for so, so long, was just gone in an instant.
I just wanted to share this, because most people I talk to about it consider doctors appointments so routine that they don't understand how big of a deal it is for me. But my white coat anxiety and HA have made life hell for so long, and this is such a weight off my shoulders :)",197,Create an account,https://old.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/osxhs2/i_did_it_i_actually_went_to_the_doctor_and_got/,,,,,1,269,21.12,1.63,87.78,2.6,20.69,4.46,0.74,3.35,2.97,0.37,2.6,1.86,0,0,0.37,5.95,3.35,0,0,0.37,0,1.86,2.23,0,0,0.74,0,0,0,0,0,5.95,0,0,5.2,0.37,0.37,6.32,3.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.74,0.74,1.49,0,0,0,7.43,8.18,2.23,0,16.36,3.72,8.18,0,0.74,1.86,1.86,0

Yesterday I went with my boyfriend to get the vaccine ( we scheduled it a week ago) but I couldn’t. I was afraid of anaphylaxis, of passing out and another thousands of different fears. I couldn’t do it and I felt like a failure, and I was disappointed in me. My parents are fully vaccinated, my friends are fully vaccinated and I couldn’t and I was so frustrated. My boyfriend did have his. So i went home yesterday and tried to stop reading all of the bad stuff about the vaccine and fill my head with positive thoughts. I found out about some drive thru vaccination and I went there. I was still scared but there were a lot of doctors there and they really made me trust. I told them I was scared and they said “ no problem, we are here for you” and they injected the vaccine and had no time to say anything anymore haha. I was really scared the 20 minutes after but it really helped having an oximeter with me to see that I’m fine. 
Now i’m laying in bed with a little headache and feeling like I just caught a cold but nothing major. I’m happy I did it and proud of me.
Oh and this week I also had the courage to use the metro and I did not have a panic attack.. I also had 3 presentations in the same day at UNI and I managed it. I’m so happy.. and if I can do it, you can do it too.

76,2020-11-06T05:27:16+00:00,magicxxmoon,Rating things Ive had HA over.,"Stroke/Anyruesm/Heart attack/Heart failure
I give 5 stars. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ because when Im not panicking over literally ANYTHING else. These guys got my back. 

Poisoning.
I panic about being poisoned often because I am VERY dummy and often accidentally swallow potentially harmful chemicals almost on the daily. I give 3 stars. ⭐⭐⭐. Because all the ones Ive panicked about so far, Ive survived, and had a very high chance of survival and the panic was annoying and completely unnecessary.
Headaches/Chest pains.
I give a whopping ZERO stars because EVERY headache/chest pain is something very serious and worth an ER visit EVERYTIME its present and no matter HOW many scans and labs are done, IM NEVER CONVINCED IM OKAY. ZERO STARS.
Sneeze/Cough.
I give four stars. ⭐⭐⭐⭐. Because, this one sends me to google immediately and the results are always ""common cold"" to ""would you prefer burial or cremation you have mere seconds to live"". I would give it 5 stars, because every time Ive had these symptoms, it is a common cold without fail. But the anxiety I experience with it is absolutely ridiculous and overdone for something as simple as a sneeze and a cough, resulting in 4 stars instead of 5.
Body twitches/any bodily pain at all.
One star. ⭐. Because this one literally has my brain like panicdeathdyingpanicdyingdeathpanic and its seriously 100% of the time just my anxiety.
Unnecessary I hate it the worst 0/10 recommend. 
But, one star because at least its just anxiety. 
Acid reflux/nausea/frequent bathroom visits.
I give ZERO stars. Always ends in a google search which ends in an ER visit which ends in me being told Im fine which ends in me not believing Im fine which ends in more google searches and another hospital visit which ends in me feeling worthless at night because my HA beat me AGAIN.
Tummy pain.
Constipation? Food poisoning? Diahrea? Ate too much? Ate too little? Something not agreeing with me? Anxiety?
Or, lets think more irrationally here...
GI bleed? Stomach aneurysm? Cancer? Infection? 
Liver failure? Major organ failure? Internal bleeding? Poisoned? 
Five stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ for being the most wide range thing to panic about.
Neck pains/back pains.
Back pains always have me thinking my kidneys are failing. Neck pains always have me thinking Im gonna drop dead in 000000.1 seconds. 
And always, without fail...the answer is simply that I slept on it wrong.
Zero stars. 
Weakness/Fatigue.

My body: pls can sleep? V tire. Anxious alway.
Me: why am I so weak and tired? 
My HA: oh my god we're dying. Quick! To the emergency room! We dont have long!
Me: valid.
My body: no...pls...want rest...so anxious..pls
My HA: do not listen to that DO NOT LISTEN TO ANY SOUND REASONING ONLY ME. WE ARE DYING. WE'RE ON THE VERGE OF DEATH. NEAR THE END. LAST DAY ON EARTH. ITS ALL OVER.
Me again: valid.
Five stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐.
Because AFTER the ER visit.
I get to nap.
And I always feel better after the nap.

Taking medication.

My body: bigly hurt. Much pain. 
Me: hmmm...ibuprofen? Tylenol? Aleve? Aspirin?
HA: nope, thatll only cause a stomach bleed and certain death.
My body: help!!!?!!! Bigly anxious! Need calm!
Me: reaches for anxiety pills
HA: woah woah what do you think youre doing? You trying to get yourself killed here? THOSE WILL KILL YOU. PUT THEM DOWN NEVER TAKE THEM AGAIN.
Doctor: prescribes medication to treat specific thing
Me: goes to take
HA: death is so close I can practically taste it. 
Zero stars. Least favorite. No positives here. No jokes even. I hate this one most. 
I wrote this in attempts to calm down about something I was really panicked about and it 100% worked give it a try next time your anxious!!!!

77,2021-02-01T09:08:32+00:00,Comprehensive-Top-41,Every Health Anxiety Sufferers nightmare,"It all started with the headaches. I was getting them all day for a few weeks when I decided to go to my GP  for a check up. She did a neurological exam (everything was clear) but said just to be sure let’s do a CT scan. I got the CT which was clear of anything which was great. Next was my arm jerks that felt like an electric shock. My anxiety went into overdrive and I demanded an appointment with a neurologist. 
I got referred to one of the greatest neurologists in Sydney- Dr Spira of Spira Neurology who did a complete neurological work up in her office (again, everything was clean). She said just to be sure let’s do an MRI scan. I followed orders and scheduled in for an MRI scan. I was terribly anxious and have never been more scared in my life. My next appointment with my neuro was a few days after my scan. I was thinking positively and thought this is just my health anxiety flaring up.
I got to the appointment and my Dr told me that there was an abnormality in my scan. My heart sank and I immediately started sweating. She told me that there was some kind of damage to my cerebellum and one of the sulcal spaces was enlarged. She told me she thought it was an incidental finding but said we would have to do another scan in three months.
I was mortified. I kept rereading the report over and over again. I researched every word and medical phrase. Of course I found out in my dr google adventures that an enlarged Sulcal space of the cerebellum could be indicitive of a deadly disease called Multiple System Atrophy. This disease has a 100% death rate of those affected. It is similar to Parkinson’s or ALS. Another symptom
Of this disease was electric shocks in your arms and legs that made the affected limb jolt. My
Mind went into overdrive. 
I had also been suffering from urinary problems due to a benign disease called Non bacterial prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome which makes you have abnormal urinating habits. This was also a sign of MSA. I’ve got it. I have definitely got it. I started to get extremely depressed and all I could think about was dying.
I self medicated with alcohol and drugs for three months just to get through each day. The next MRI comes around ever so slowly. I have to take several Valium’s to knock myself out for the scan.
My next appointment with my neuro is in a couple of weeks. My partner and I decide to take a holiday to take my mind of it.
The big day comes. My neurologist tells me the scan hasn’t changed which is tremendous news. She said the best neuroradiologist reviewed my file and said it looks congenital (from birth) and there’s been no change. When I tell my neuro of my fears about MSA she laughs and says no way. I tell her I have all the symptoms. She laughs again and points out all the reasons why I don’t have this disease. She said she would put her title of doctor on the line to say I do not have this disease.
The symptoms have disappeared since. I sometimes still struggle and revert to thinking I am dying but I know I’m not. The point of the story is that you can have all the symptoms of a certain disease (even imaging) and still won’t have it. I really
Empathise with everyone battling this horrid anxiety. If you don’t have it you won’t understand.
I am with you all. I have been through our worst nightmare and I came out the other side. Remember this story when battling your own demons.

I’ve been having high readings at the doctors office for years now. My readings were around 140-150 and 90-100 and my pulse readings were always in the 120-140’s.
I finally got all my tests cleared (did EKG’s and a couple other exams few years back too) and had a 24 hour blood pressure monitor cuff and everything came back normal! My average blood pressure at home when I wasn’t so stressed out about the readings was 120/80 and my pulse was in the 90’s (a little high on the pulse but keep in mind I do have an anxiety disorder and drink caffeine frequently).

She described the human body as extremely noisy - lots of noises, sensations, pains, twitches, etc. Like all anxiety disorders, the brain is hypersensitive and basically catastrophically misinterprets these “noises” that most people just ignore or don’t notice in the first place. 
I found it helpful to try and remember in the context of someone with health anxiety, that my “background noise” is just louder than most and to recognize various symptoms I feel as just that. Figured I’d share if that thought can help anyone reframe how they perceive what’s going on in their bodies. 😊",189,Create an account,https://old.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/dcg4b8/noisy_body_syndrome_hopefully_this_can_help_some/,,,,,1,126,29.12,27.1,45.24,1.48,18,11.11,3.97,7.14,3.97,0.79,3.17,2.38,0,0,0,15.87,8.73,3.17,0,0,0,3.17,7.14,0,0,0.79,0.79,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.32,6.35,1.59,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.59,0,0,0,0,0,6.35,5.56,1.59,19.05,4.76,5.56,0,0,2.38,6.35,0.79

88,2022-02-22T21:32:43+00:00,Wevvie,"After nearly one year of MS symptoms, I did a brain MRI and...","Here's my story. I'm a 23 yo Hispanic male, and starting from June 2021, I started having:
Headaches and I've never had them before in my life. They're one-sided, mostly dull and constant, rarely lancinating, but didn't throb.
A dramatic increase in eye floaters, though I remember seeing some of them when I was a kid. Not sure if they were always there and I began noticing them more, or indeed more appeared.
Fatigue. Most days I could barely work. 
Blue entoptic phenomena, and a random black dot appearing around the center of vision once every few days.
Throbbing eye pain, pain when moving my eyes (akin to Optic Neuritis), red sore eyes, dry eyes, blurring and worsening vision on my right eye (astigmatism)
Double vision, WHOEVER, it was monocular diplopia (double vision in one eye, due to my newly found astigmatism or dry eyes I guess), which at the time eased my anxiety a bit since MS double vision is mostly binocular.
Weird numbness/tingling feelings going down my legs and arms on one side of the body (left). Random patches would get numb, or the whole limb would go ""numbish"".
Random calf pains and twitches all over the body. Walking felt weird.
All the above symptoms came and went. At times they were super noticeable, other, barely or not noticeable.  
Went to 2 different eye doctors, both said my retina was 100% healthy. No inflammation, bleeding or anything going on inside my eye or optic nerve.
So, I appointed an MRI last week. I was afraid of it either being MS, a tumor, or some huge unruptured aneurysm that would change my life. Got my results today and went to the neuro (super cool and chill guy btw) the same day, shitting my pants, taking a Xanax beforehand to prepare me for my impending ""doom"", and he said:
""Looks like a perfectly healthy brain to me. No signs of abnormalities, aneurysms, or lesions. One of the healthiest I've seen actually!""
I felt like a huge weight dropped from my back, which I'd been carrying for a year! I'm finally free of those absurd thoughts and now I can live normally without getting paranoid.
For the person reading: If you're afraid of your symptoms and you think it's MS: Stay calm. Most likely it's not. AND even if it indeed is, MS is super treatable today. Many people live totally normal lives, as long as you catch it as soon as possible.
Also, I work from home (and play from my PC), so I spend 16+ hours sitting down every single day for 3+ years, and I know I used to have SHIT posture. So, the culprit might be something related to my spine, which I will further investigate.
UPDATE: 07/02/2023 (February 7th, 2023)
I just got a lumbar MRI and it looks like it was all caused by a disc protrusion in L4/L5 and L5/S1. No lesions BTW.
I'm afraid I may also have some bulging disc in my neck (which might explain the arm tingling).
So yeah, while not necessarily good news, it's preferable to having MS, and much easier to deal with too.",189,Create an account,https://old.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/syyzf6/after_nearly_one_year_of_ms_symptoms_i_did_a/,,,,,1,544,30.34,4.3,96.24,10.98,15.54,4.96,1.84,2.76,2.39,0.37,2.02,0.92,0,0,0.37,5.7,2.21,0,1.1,0,0.18,0.92,4.23,0,0,1.1,0.55,0.37,0,0.18,0.18,1.47,0.18,0.18,0.92,0.18,0,10.11,5.7,2.39,0.37,0.37,0.18,0,0,0,0,0,1.1,0,0,0.37,6.99,5.7,3.49,1.65,23.53,6.43,7.72,0,0.37,2.39,6.62,0

I visited the dermatologist a couple of weeks ago to have something benign evaluated. While I was there she asked if I’d ever had a skin check, and when I said no, she said, “I’m going to be honest, you need one.”
Oh, cool.
Cue a week+ of spiraling, obsessive checking of my moles (the very same moles that I’ve seen every single day for the last however many years), no sleep, no appetite, blaming myself for waiting so long. I used to work in healthcare marketing and I know all the warning signs of melanoma...and I was sure, SURE I had it. 
I was up in a cold sweat at 3 a.m. imagining the biopsies she would take, the waiting for results, the next steps...I can’t remember the last time I’ve been that anxious about anything. I could barely even speak to my girlfriend. 
Well I went to the appointment and...everything is fine. Nothing suspicious. No biopsies. And she looked everywhere (I mean everywhere.) We spent the last ten minutes of the appointment talking about our favorite skincare products. I go back in a year.
I wanted to share this because y’all, I was SO SURE something was up. One of my moles...big, raised, multicolored, even started “tingling” a few days before my appointment. But the doctor looked at it and said it was normal and actually a low-risk spot. 
I am glad I went—preventive care is an act of self-care, even when it makes you want to run and hide. Of course, it’s easy for me to say that when I’m on the other side of it. But yeah, I was in a bad place before this appointment.

98,2020-07-17T17:02:56+00:00,QueenAnne89,Had an emergency appendectomy last night and I’m really proud of how I dealt with it,"I just wanted to share this personal success story in hopes that it will make someone else less anxious about medical procedures.
I have had anxiety since as long as I can remember. I remember being like 5 years old and staying awake all night due to insomnia and worry. My biggest anxiety related fear is health anxiety. I’ve spent hours googling minor symptoms, have gone to urgent care when literally nothing was wrong with me multiple times, and felt crazy pretty much all the time. I tend to ignore medical issues out of fear that they’re the worst possible scenario. I wasn’t given that option yesterday as scared as I was I am feeling so much better about my health anxiety today. 
Long story short (ish), I had a dull pain in my lower right side starting on Wednesday morning. It kind of hurt when I walked or moved a certain way, but it wasn’t excruciating. When I woke up yesterday, it was tender to the touch and I knew that probably meant something serious was wrong. I took myself to urgent care and they said to go to the ER immediately. I have no family in this part of the state and my boyfriend was working, so I had to get admitted by myself. Due to the virus, I learned upon being admitted that I could not have any visitors at all. This is when I started to freak out because being not only terrified and not knowing what was wrong with me, now I had to be ALONE through all of it. 
They performed a CT scan and determined that I did indeed have appendicitis and it needed to be removed immediately, like that day in a few hours. All I could do was frantically text/call my family and my boyfriend. I was so terrified and I let the nurses know about my anxiety/depression diagnosis. They were all super understanding and nice. 
About an hour goes by and someone comes into my room and announces that I’m going to pre-op right now. I had minimal time to text anyone and was wheeled away to the OR. For some reason, although I was scared shitless I knew that there was nothing I could do and I just had to let it happen. I’m home today in less than 24 hours recovering well. And I even drove myself home. I did all of this completely alone in my worst nightmare anxiety scenario. 
After refusing SSRI’s for the better part of a decade, I began taking lexapro about 6 months ago. It has helped me tremendously and I think that has a lot to do with why I was able to stay so calm (at least outwardly). Also, letting every nurse/doctor that I came into contact with that i was incredibly anxious and fearful seemed to help so much. They were great and made a horrible experience at least bearable. 
I know medication isn’t right for everyone and I’m just saying that I personally have noticed a huge improvement with my anxiety symptoms since I began taking lexapro. I’m just so proud of myself for not panicking and just getting through it. I actually feel more confident now about my ability to handle stress and ask for help when I need it. 
I hate that we all experience this shitty feeling all the time but you are not alone. And I think it can get better over time.",173,Create an account,https://old.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/hszfcs/had_an_emergency_appendectomy_last_night_and_im/,,,,,1,597,14.55,1.49,98.81,5.23,18.09,9.21,3.52,5.36,5.03,0.84,4.02,3.35,0.17,0.17,0.17,7.2,3.69,0.84,0,0.17,0.5,1.34,3.02,0.34,0.34,0,0.34,0.17,0,0,0.17,1.34,0,0.5,0.67,0.17,0,3.35,2.68,0.5,0,0.34,0,0,0,0,1.84,0.34,1.01,1.01,0,0.17,7.54,10.05,4.19,0.67,10.72,5.53,2.01,0,0,1.84,1.34,0

Every morning, I’d wake up with a pit in my stomach and that looming feeling of impending doom would follow me throughout the day. I always felt like I’d die young, that my doctors were just “missing something.”
Well this year I finally did something about it. With the right combination of medications and continued therapy sessions, I have a new life. Some days I feel like I’m walking into a war zone at work, but I’ve also never felt happier to finally realize that I am healthy. I will wake up tomorrow. And I. Am. Not. Dying.

Just because you're worried you have a brain tumor or cancer, it doesn't mean you're any more likely to get it compared to anyone else. Our anxiety isn't a sign that something is wrong, other than, well, our anxiety. I've had these thoughts. Countless thoughts. I internalized this idea that the harder I looked, the closer I would get to find what was wrong with me physically. I wondered if my health anxiety was so severe during the pandemic partly because it was a sign.. that I was going to get the disease. Somehow I believed my brain has this predictive power.

Writers employ search engine optimization and plug in key phrases in the article that you might commonly google to make it rank higher than others. They may name the photo files as the same phrase as what you're most likely to google. They will include scary words in the google description which is written under the name of the article. The more people that click that article, the higher it ranks in google. Fear sells. If you visit that article and click an ad, they'll make money. 
Try this. Google ""lump in throat"" and click the first article that catches your attention on top of google. Look closely at the article. You'll see how many times the word ""lump in throat"", ""lump in your throat"", or even ""something stuck in throat"" is repeated throughout the article. Look for the phrase being modified a few times. The phrase you typed in was the reason that article showed up on top of Google. If they tie the word ""cancer"" into it, they have more of a chance of getting several people to click on it out of fear. Not sure if you realized it or not, but keep it in mind if you google.

My roommate dropped me off to the clinic and the line was already so long. My ex partner lives with us (we are good friends) and works at the clinic. they came out to greet me and tell me it’ll be okay because 20 minutes in I’m having heart palpitations, chest feels right, feel like I can’t breathe, that I’ll faint, etc etc. 
I practiced my deep breathing and had my mom comfort me and a few friends distract me over text.
Regardless, I waited in line for an HOUR. I’m sure y’all know how terrible it is to be having a panic attack for a whole HOUR! But when I got there, there was my ex sitting at the table waving me over to check me in. They chuckled, “your poor hands! You’re shaking!” And we laughed about that. 
By the time I got to where they were giving the shots, I was fine. Obviously still having the physical effects, but I was able to recite how safe I knew what I was doing is, and how wonderful my life is going to be now that I’m doing something so challenging for me. I didn’t shake at all for the shot, in fact that’s when I was the absolutely calmest. 
I don’t regret this at all. I feel proud that I didn’t let the paranoia stop me from taking a life saving vaccine. Seriously. This is incredible for me and I feel like sobbing even thinking about it. Wow. 
Please y’all. Get it. the only true thing to fear IS fear itself!!!

126,2020-10-06T09:16:12+00:00,IbrahimT13,A frustrating thing about health anxiety is that it makes me unable to discern what's actually a problem and what's anxiety,"My health anxiety started because of some movement-related eye pain I've been having since late July/early August. At first I didn't think anything of it but then a couple weeks later the anxiety started and I contacted a doctor. I got some reassurance at first because my doctor didn't seem worried and the optometrist didn't find anything - but since then I've been hyperanalyzing everything wrong with myself. 
First it was occasional headaches, then unsteadiness/vertigo, then some depersonalization (occasional), then some chills (short lived), to maybe a plugged feeling in my ears, to occasional pain in my other eye (stopped recently), and now constant tinnitus. 
At first I was taking everything super seriously but now that I know health anxiety is a thing and what anxiety can do to someone I've become somewhat less worried about everything except the eye pain and tinnitus, which I still have. I have a referral now for an MRI but till then I'm just sort of existing, trying to tell myself all the things I'm feeling are just anxiety. Mostly I've been succeeding but other times I'm convinced I have something horrible lol.
The annoying problem I'm having is that I know something is wrong with me, I just don't know how bad it is and I can't really trust myself to monitor my own symptoms because most are probably just anxiety. It's a fact that my eye is hurting but what that actually means remains to be seen. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",156,Create an account,https://old.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/j61x48/a_frustrating_thing_about_health_anxiety_is_that/,,,,,1,268,5.17,1,99,1,26.8,8.58,1.12,7.46,6.34,0,6.34,3.73,0.75,0,0,3.73,3.36,0,0,0.37,0.75,0.75,0.37,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.49,0,0,1.49,0,0,7.84,5.22,2.61,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.75,0.37,0,0,10.07,6.72,8.21,0,18.66,3.36,3.36,0,0,5.97,5.97,0

They will use the data from your searches to give you relevant ads and articles and it will exacerbate your HA.,"There have been times where I've frantically googled the symptoms for everything from MS to brain tumors to ruptured ovarian cysts and shortly afterwards I would see an ad or an article about something related to it-- nearby gynecologists, cancer centers, etc. But since I've stopped doing that, I don't see them as much anymore. It's been really helpful in taming my anxieties. 
Googling something once every so often doesn't affect the algorithm too much I don't think, but when you're a chronic symptom-checker (like I used to be), triggering ads definitely start becoming more prevalent.

It is a difficult, painful, and paralyzing disease. It can twist your thoughts and make you believe that you are dying in the blink of an eye, that your heavy breaths will be your last, or that the re-occuring headache is a tumor. That even showering can give you a brain-eating parasite, or that the weird bruise on your knee is something deadly.
Unlike many of these thoughts, health anxiety is real. It’s awful. It’s difficult to stay calm. But here you still are, despite all the scares, despite all the anxiety and paranoid thoughts, you are here. Breathing. Blinking. Reading this. You are living through something that feels so real it can paralyze you with fear and make your entire life flash before your eyes, but you. are. still. here.
You are a warrior. Keep fighting. We can all get through this in the end.

So many of us engage in unhealthy behaviors that will inevitably lead to the disease we so dread. So many of us worry about non-preventable disease that we forget to do what we can to prevent preventable disease. So many of us have a self-defeating mentality that we will always struggle with HA and that there's nothing to be done about it but suffer through it. But there ARE steps to take, healthy habits to practice, and real solutions to address the root of our anxiety. And this subreddit should be a hub for that kind of supportive information, a beacon of hope for people who can't stop worrying about their health and need practical, tangible help. Let's not wallow, let's do the work, together. Can we hold each other accountable for unsafe/unhealthy behaviors, check up on each other, be more intentional with our posts? Can we cultivate a culture of real healing rather than just putting out endless fires?

137,2021-08-15T08:38:49+00:00,megalonagyix,The science behind our health anxiety (OCD) in laymans terms - and how to break the cycle,"Hey guys,
I spent the weekend researching this monster of an illness, and I want to share some thoughts as to why this thing is happening to all of us. 
So for the vast majority of us, this is a combination of OCD + anxiety. It is not simply anxiety, because we spend days and weeks on fixating symptoms, which becomes and obsession, and then we want to eliminate that symptom at all costs (going to the doctor, checking for those bumps and changes, asking this place, friend for reassurance, etc.) As for anxiety, we notice a sensation (we are hypersensitized at this point) and we perceive that as a threat, our body enter the good old fight or flight mode. This is the ""trigger"" for the OCD, aka the obsession. At this point we start Googling or asking for reassurance (compulsion) to mitigate the symptoms. Then when it goes away, it gives a temporary relief, until the next sensation comes along. Anxiety also causes us to jump the worst of the conclusions. You are probably like this (and like me) in other facets of life too, as in ""if i fail this exam, I will never finish uni, never have a job, I will end up homeless"".
Googling is the worst offender, because you look up your symptoms (which are psychosomatic, btw. - as in they exist, but don't have a medical explanation as to why they exist) - you find a horde of new symptoms of the condition you are obsessed about - and soon enough you will start developing those symptoms too. It's pointless to google, because we don't have a medical condition, and that's where we make our mistakes. Our bodies create symptoms because of the things we read about - why do our bodies do this to ourselves? Because the body perceives the things you read about as a threat - makes up symptoms for you to go to the doctor - so you can be safe. 
So how to break the chain? You need to treat both OCD AND anxiety.

""Cold water"" method for OCD: It's when you first go to work, you feel anxious to live up to everyone's expectation. You are extremely out of your comfort zone, but then as each day passes, you sensitize yourself to your job, and it won't cause anxiety anymore. Same with OCD: you need to jump in the cold water, you need to stop doing the obsessive behavior that generates the OCD loop. This is a long ass time, so don't expect results immidiately.
As for anxiety: You need to be outside the comfort zone, each minute of the day. Going back to video games won't cure you, it will just mask the problem. Look up Wim Hof method, or David Goggins for starters.
As for the most difficult thing: how do I know if I'm actually in need of medical examination? Just take a damn risk. It's better than living this way. If the problem gets worse, doesn't go away after 2 weeks, you notice additional symptoms (actual symptoms like fever, bloody stool, etc.) then yeah, go ahead and get it checked.

What won't work:

Meditation - it can give you a peace of mind, but it won't cure OCD and anxiety.
Clean eating
Deep breathing
And all those extra recommendations those health sites gives you. Feel free to do them anyway because of amazing benefits, but these alone won't cure OCD.

Why they won't work? Because they don't treat the underlying problem, aka. the OCD loop. Break the loop!

A couple of months ago I was tired of constantly staying up with anxiety attacks over random pains in my body. I had been riddled with health anxiety for over 2 years. My anxiety was so bad I would wake up my poor fiancé and make him drive me to the hospital at 2 or 3 am because I was convinced I was dying. I finally decided enough was enough after trying “holistic medicine” and reached out to a psychiatrist. He put me on Lexapro combined with online therapy sessions and lessons I could access to help track and aid my coping mechanisms. It’s been about 6 months since I started and I feel better than ever! I no longer cry myself to sleep because of a headache I had or a pain on my side. I used to use this sub to confirm or compare symptoms but now, I just have stopped looking at the posts. The point is that it DOES get better. Please find someone to help you because it’s a relief to be freed from the constant anxiety and stress.

Like I said, there was very little logical basis to this. 
I didn't want to go straight to the hospital again - the process takes hours upon hours, and I was determined to break the compulsive habit since I had gotten my heart checked out there not long ago at all, and I was totally fine.
However I couldn't possibly stay home by myself, I was driving myself up the walls with anxiety. I kept feeling like I was dying. Instead, I brought my laptop and sketchbook to this cafe that's open late near where I live. I simply got a drink and sat there watching Netflix and drawing and trying to distract myself.
This actually calmed me down substantially. I was in a different environment, and also there were other people around. If I did somehow spontaneously pass out, someone would call 911.

It’s also like if I stopped feeling anxious for one minute about every single process, I wouldn’t pay attention and then I would miss some important symptom that could possibly be my demise. It’s a painful hyper awareness and I am so very tired of this. I don’t know if anyone here has overcome or at least have gotten to a point where you feel better about your health anxiety, but if there is I would like to know what your tactics were to just like... trust your body is doing the best it can.

It can also make you more aware of perfectly normal traits and twinges that you’ve always had, but had never paid attention to until now.

162,2020-10-14T20:42:14+00:00,mushface83,You’re ok,"Inspired by a post earlier to give some encouragement! I’ve loved finding this group, partially for seeing how common the things I worry about/physically experience are, but also to give advice from my perspective of being (mostly) (kinda?) on the other side of HA and actually help.
You will one day realise you haven’t thought you were dying in a minute. You’ll have a physical sensation and think, after your initial worst case scenario jump, oh fuck it’s been ages since I had this feeling and then thought - wow. It doesn’t mean you won’t ever think it again. My recovery looks like not reacting to the panic thought, but recognising the context. The thought is still there but it’s more toothless. If I’m away from home, if I’m in a stressful situation, if I’m nervous: hey presto, either my chest hurts, I feel dizzy, my stomach hurts, my arms tingle, i can’t breathe properly, I have short stabbing headaches, my muscles feel atrophied, my heart beats weird or hard - it’s always something (or a number of somethings). But I knew it would in that context. 
For me it was a combination of CBT and the DARE app. It’s subscription but in my financial position, honestly compared to the amount of solace I found in their guided panic attack and health anxiety modules, it was more than worth it. 
Your physical sensations are your brain thinking it’s taking care of you. The last 15 panic attacks/headaches/chest pain/etc didn’t kill you. This one won’t either.
Just sending love and support to you all, my inbox is open (I’m not online all the time but I will respond when I can). You will get through this. You are more than your physical sensations. See a GP or specialist if something persists but then - crucially - you have to accept it if they do tests and tell you your body is fine. This was one of the hardest things for me. ECG, MRI, blood tests, cervical screenings (repeated ones) all ok...and then a week later I’m thinking “what if that was too early and they missed it?” 
They didn’t. I know it seems fucking impossible, but I promise you with everything I have - you’ll get through your health anxiety and you’ll sleep, you won’t be scared to exercise, you’ll spend DAYS, weeks, months maybe not worrying about your demise. 
I believe in you! (And apologies if this is annoying to you cuz you’re in the thick of it - I get that it’s sometimes frustrating to hear. But you don’t have to believe it right now, but I do, for you.)
ETA: I quit caffeine at the height of it and I was shocked at the results (sounds like clickbait 😂)
I had thought for like 15 years I had insomnia. I quit caffeine and started sleeping 7-8 hours a night.

You are an individual who shares a headspace with an obnoxious and persistent roommate named Anxiety. You likely have little to no knowledge and training of how the human body and disease processes work. Your only source of information is Google, which provides you basic pieces of info but without any context at all to put the medical puzzle together with any accuracy.
And yet, we are prone to listen to the anxiety when it whispers, ""what if you have [disease]?"" or ""you should Google it."" And then we attempt to diagnose ourselves. I see posts here often that say: ""I have convinced myself that I have [disease]."" ""I have diagnosed myself with [disease]."" ""I am 100% certain that I have [disease].""
And to that I say, you are not at all qualified to make that determination. Honestly, imagine setting an appointment with a doctor, going to your appointment, and meeting the person who is supposed to diagnose and treat you. Imagine that person had never gone to medical school. Imagine that their only source of information was WebMD. Imagine that they had dozens, hundreds, thousands of misdiagnoses on their track record and have only been correct once or twice, if ever. Would you take them seriously or value their medical opinion at all?

166,2019-04-09T21:12:47+00:00,Silent-Week8770,Aneurysm Relief,"Hello everyone, I should mention that if the concept of a brain aneurysm bothers you, this post may make you anxious, however, the intention is to provide relief to people in my situation by sharing some statistics I've dug up regarding brain aneurysms. Here are the statistics:
​
In the United States, the general public has a 5% chance of developing an aneurysm in their lifetime.
This affects women more than men at a ratio of 3:2.
Of these, 85-90% never show symptoms.
Of these, only around 1% occur in children under 18. Presumably, the number is not greatly higher in young adults (20's), though I was not able to find direct statistics on that.
Of all aneurysms, only around 1% of aneurysms will ever rupture. Around 99% of people with unruptured brain aneurysms never have to worry about it and die from something else.
Of these, many cases correlate to other risk factors (Genetics, lifestyle habits)
Of this, survival rate is as high as 60%.
​
Based off this, it's reasonable to conclude that the odds for an otherwise healthy person in their 20's with no risk factors to have an aneurysm are very, very unlikely, rarer than being struck by lightning. Literally. Furthermore, while it may seem scary that they cause no symptoms, it also may help a hypochondriac to realize that their symptoms are psychosomatic (imagined, caused by anxiety), though of course, if symptoms do arise and persist, it's important to discuss them with a doctor. Also keep in mind that the symptoms of a ruptured aneurysm are unmistakable.

172,2020-10-30T04:37:02+00:00,HealthAnxiety-ModTeam,HELPFUL AFFIRMATIONS THAT HAVE HELPED ME,"The following have really helped me. 
1) I have felt this before, and every time I have gone through this, I have been okay. All I’m feeling is my brain misfiring. My brain just needs to calm down and relax. My brain needs calm support. I will provide myself support by listening to beautiful music, by watching videos that make me laugh and think about interesting things.
2) I am okay, if anything serious were wrong with me, I would KNOW it. I would not be able to calm down after an hour or two, maybe more. (panic feelings can last anywhere from 1 hour to more than 3-5 days. This is NORMAL.)
3) if I can go throughout the day laughing and talking with friends and family, and I feel fine whenever I am DISTRACTED, that means I AM OKAY, it is just anxiety. I only feel anxiety when I am not busy enough. 
4) Even if I am not distracted, I AM SAFE. When I am relaxed and it is night time, I AM SAFE.
4) being relaxed will not harm me. Just because I am relaxed, it doesn’t mean something bad will happen. I deserve to feel calm. I am safe, my body knows how to heal itself.
5) Anxiety is scientifically proven to cause sensations that aren’t real. The more I think about it, the more I will feel. 
6) deep breath in, count to 5. Breathe from diaphragm. Listen to soothing atmospheric/ambient music while doing so. Focus on the music and my slow breathing... see? I am okay. My brain misfired for a few, but now I am in control. I am okay. This will always pass, I have nothing to worry about. 
7) It is safe to observe every feeling in my body. Do not react to these feelings, only observe and treat them like floating clouds passing by. I entertain positive thoughts only. 
8) Being sensitized to anxiety has no place now. 
9) Healing is natural now for me, starting today. From this point forward, I will overcome and control my reactions to misfirings in my brain. My brain is just wired differently, and that is NOT dangerous. 
10) Drink peppermint or chamomile tea, Bite into a lemon, or take a slow, long sniff of an essential oil, such as peppermint, lavender, or eucalyptus. Taste and smell will overcome your anxiety and focus. So that way, you will be distracted from the anxiousness you are feeling. 
11) My anxiety is worse at night because I am not distracted and I am afraid help will not reach me in time. Those thoughts are false, I know I will be okay, because I’m the morning, I am completely normal and distracted by the duties of the new day. I will treat my mind and body to the relaxation and sleep it deserves. I will be safe. 
12) I have been to the doctor many times, and each time, they confirm I am okay. They are professionals, they KNOW I am okay. Anxiety is powerful, it has the ability to delude me, to cause me to feel miserable. But I will NOT let that happen from this point forward. It is time for me to take control and realize that I need to live life in the moment. I cannot let this cycle continue.",134,Create an account,https://old.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/jkqdjn/helpful_affirmations_that_have_helped_me/,,,,,1,565,11.52,1,97.57,62.01,11.53,8.67,5.66,3.01,4.78,2.48,2.3,1.95,0,0,0,4.25,2.48,1.24,0,0,0.53,0.53,1.59,0.18,0.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.12,1.59,0,0.53,0,0,4.25,0.88,0,0.71,0,0,0,0.53,0,0.53,0,0.35,0,0.18,0,6.02,1.42,10.27,2.3,19.12,8.85,6.37,0.18,0,0.71,3.01,0
173,2020-08-18T21:22:28+00:00,londonverse,Psychology Tip,"Hey guys! I saw my psych yesterday and she showed me this super simple technique to help with some of those unhelpful thoughts we get.
Whenever you get a health anxiety thought eg. “What if I have [insert illness]” write it down on a piece of paper, count how many words there are and just start decorating it. Put hearts above the i’s, put clouds around every word, colour in all the holes of the letters. Just make it look as silly as you possibly can. When the sentence looks silly you start to distance yourself from that thought. 
It doesn’t have to be this either. You can imagine yourself walking through a shopping centre and every person is wearing a t-shirt with your unhelpful thought on it. Or imagine it on a billboard.

Well, I swallowed my anxiety today and took my ass to the ER because it was getting debilitating. They did a CT scan of my head that came back 100% normal! The health anxiety part of my brain is telling me CT scans can miss stuff, but I trust my doctors, the likelihood of the scan missing something as drastic as a brain tumor is highly unlikely, and I know if something was abnormal, I wouldn’t be at home right now writing this post. 
My blood pressure was high and they said my headaches are likely chronic tension headaches that were aggravated by my anxiety causing high blood pressure. But I’m in the clear, and I’m so relieved.
Take it from me, yall. Anxiety is a beast and can cause such horrible physical symptoms, especially if it’s prolonged. Just try to take control of it and do whatever you need to do to calm your mind.

Seriously, though, for those of you who google your symptoms, stop. All it will do is make you feel a thousand times worse, and Dr. Google really needs to get it's license taken away. 
Go for a walk, do some dishes, fold some laundry. Do a puzzle or color, we are never too old to enjoy things like puzzles and coloring books. 
Avoid google for an hour. One hour will become two, then it'll be a half a day. Soon it'll be a full day, and before you know it, a week will have gone by and guess what? I bet you feel a little more calm than what you would have if you'd spent that last week doing nothing but googling. 
You will probably have setbacks. I know I did. I went three weeks before, did a ""harmless"" google search a week ago. But here's the thing about Health Anxiety... There's no such thing as a harmless google search. It will suck you in, it will dig in tight with its claws, and it won't let you go until you are having your panic attack. And then it will cause you to either continue to panic, or do what I did and make an panicky emergency doctor's appointment about something I swear I had, only to find out... I'm completely fine. All thanks to what started off as a harmless google search that spiraled into a dark area.
But you can pull yourself out, and move on from that setback. Don't beat yourself up about it, but instead, use that experience as a chance to learn. Move forward, try again. 
So, trust me. Stop googling, please. We can beat this, we are all strong enough.

You stop what you’re doing, you hop on Google and Google your symptom, now you’re stressing even more because Dr Google (who by the way will give you the worst case scenario in a ploy to get you to go to the doctors and spend money.. it’s different here in the uk as healthcare is free..) has now convinced you you have a deadly disease. Everything in your life is now pointless because no matter how hard you work towards your goals, relationships, fitness, you’ll be dead within 6-12 months right?
A few days go by, your “symptom” hasn’t disappeared and you’re too scared to go and see a doctor because “what I don’t know can’t hurt me” right? You feel lethargic, any feeling or sensation in your body is because your so called disease has spread and you’re waiting on your so called inevitable end.

You don’t wanna console with your family because you don’t want them worrying, especially your parents.
Health anxiety is a dark place, and the lump you’re feeling is more than likely nothing to worry about, everyone is at risk of bad things happening, but us with health anxiety worry about it 10x more, and it’s hard to see a bright future when you think you’re gonna fall in to the category of young people who get cancer.

I’ve been constantly worrying about MS for the past month and a half.  It started with my left foot being numb and then my right hand was constantly tingling and numb at the fingertips, brain fog, twitching.  I had to wait a month to go the neurologist with all of these symptoms — which were CONSTANT.  Made a trip to the ER to see if I could get the MRI to rule it out there and just ended up with a referral. 
I got a brain and spine MRI which both came back completely normal.   Anxiety is REAL and it can produce REAL symptoms.

To sum up, about 7-8 months ago, I began getting dizzy spells out of the blue. Vertigo, and then a constant feeling of swaying/off balance. 
I flipped out. My HA was through the roof. I saw three doctors, who diagnosed me with some inner ear problem and assured me it would go away eventually. I didn’t believe them though and was convinced I had a brain tumour or MS or something. 
The anxiety destroyed me. I couldn’t sleep, eat, enjoy life. I was suicidal at one point because I just felt panicky all the time and couldn’t stand the feeling of being off balance. Sometimes there were triggers for it, sometimes it just happened. It was every day though and caused me so much stress. 
After 3 months, I got an MRI, bloodwork and CT scan. I was terrified but glad I got them. They all came back normal! It was such a relief.
I went to see a vestibular physiotherapist who performed some tests and agreed with the doctors that it was an inner ear issue (he thinks BPPV). He told me that everyone heals at a different rate, and to do exercises to help retrain my brain to not get dizzy so easily. 
It’s been around 7-8 months since this started, and things are a lot better. It’s not gone, but the exercises helped a lot and I no longer fear the dizzy sensation all the time.
If I had just trusted my doctors in the first place with their initial diagnosis, I could’ve saved myself so much grief and pain. I’m going to do my best from now on to listen to what they say. And stay off Google!! I have successfully avoided this, even though I’ve had other small health scares pop up. I’ve learned that the less I talk about it (ideally not at all), and with no Google/body scanning that the anxiety comes and goes quickly. 
Anyways, just wanted to post this for anyone else who may have similar symptoms. All was normal with me and it very likely is for you too! Obviously check with a doctor if you’re unsure, but if they tell you you’re fine then you are!

This will be a long post, but I think it will also be a helpful one for those of you who are struggling to cope or have not yet had access to CBT. I am not a therapist, nor am I attempting to counsel. However, I have learned some strategies in therapy that are slowly helping me, and I thought for those who have not heard these, perhaps they could be of use.
I'd like to start by saying that I do not subscribe to this sub. I did for a while, and I found that it actually fed my health anxiety. Constantly seeing posts by people who were seeking reassurance would always put a new and frightening illness on my radar. So now, I occasionally check back when I am in a deep state of anxiety. The key difference, however, between checking then and checking now, is what I'm looking for. 
When I used to look at the sub, it was because I too was seeking reassurance. I wanted to know what others were struggling with, if my symptoms matched up with other peoples symptoms and if I discovered a new ailment along the way, well then great, I could add another to the long list of things that would kill be before I turned 25 (next April). 
When I look at this sub now, however, I don't look to the posts; I look to the comments. I am not seeking reassurance, but rather evidence. In CBT, my therapist has been working with me on the importance of building evidence, both for AND against the disease I am concerned about at that moment. I give you an example.
A snapshot of me right now:
Age: 24
Gender: Male
Medical History: Nothing significant
Family History: bowel cancer and melanoma (however, these are not relevant to my current state of anxiety)
Current symptoms:
- aching pain in my left leg for the last 6 weeks - am now getting pain in both legs on alternating days
- muscle twitches (fasciculations) in both legs, primarily above the knee, but all over and in other areas of my body
- slight weakness in my sore legs and my left arm
Testing/treatment I have had done regarding these symptoms:
- lumbar MRI (clear with minor wear and tear)
- X-Ray (left leg) (awaiting results)
- regular physiotherapy visits, treating for referred pain from back
What I'm afraid of:
- ALS/MND/MS
- Bone cancer
For a couple of weeks I was a MESS. I was having panic attacks that I had ALS/MND. My muscle twitches were going haywire. I couldn't sleep. I was getting tingles down my leg and left arm. Then I started to actually pay attention to my therapist, and some helpful commentors on this sub. Below is what my evidence for and against all of these things looks like:
Evidence that I DO have ALS:
- I have muscle twitches, which is a symptom of ALS
- Muscular pain is sometimes a symptom of ALS
- I feel some minor weakness (but nothing that stops me walking or grasping things) in my sore legs and arm.
Evidence that I DO NOT have ALS:
- I am 24 years old - most cases of this disease occur in people over 40, and often, closer to 60.
- I have no family history. While most cases of ALS occur in people with no family history, almost ALL cases in people below 30 or 40 are familial related.
- Muscle twitches - while there are exceptions as with anything - are usually a later stage symptom of the disease.
- There is very little medical study into muscle twitches because they are considered to be of little medical significance. In other words, they are SO common and have hundreds of causes (plus hundreds more that doctors likely do not know about), all of which are FAR more likely than ALS, this symptom alone means little to nothing. A quote I saw online, but cannot remember where, said, 'Remember, muscle twitches are common, ALS is not.'
- The prevalence of ALS is about 1 or 2 in 100, 000. That's only between 10 and 20 in every 1, 000, 000. Or between 100 and 200 in every 20, 000, 000 people. Those numbers are pretty good.
- Generally before other symptoms, people will experience clinical weakness in their limbs, i.e. unable to walk properly, unable to hold a mug. Not just tripping, minor losses in dexterity or even minor foot dragging/tripping.
- I have been clumsy my ENTIRE LIFE. It's a running joke between my girlfriend and I about how clumsy I am.
- the weakness and soreness in my left arm is probably from a tendinitis injury I have struggled with on and off for the last 5 years.
Evidence that I DO have bone cancer:
- my legs hurt.
Evidence that I DO NOT have bone cancer:
- I had a lumbar MRI come back clean, meaning nothing in lymphatic system, nothing in my spinal column, no tumours causing referred pain
- no family history
- I have had an x-ray and while I do not yet have the results, if they come back negative, that's about as conclusive as you can get.
Conclusion:
All we need to do is look at the evidence. I probably don't have ALS or bone cancer. It's far more likely that I have some mechanical fault in my legs or a muscular issue that will probably resolve with some physiotherapy.
True, there are no absolutes in life. True, I COULD have one of these horrible diseases. Nobody on planet Earth can guarantee I or anybody else doesn't. But, the statistical likelihood of me having these ailments is so minuscule that it isn't even worth worrying about. And I know telling a person with health anxiety not to worry about health is like telling a dog not to smell another dog's butt and I'd be lying if I said this was a cure for my anxiety. It isn't. I still have low days and I still have weak moments. But what this has helped  with is coping on a day-to-day basis.
I won't tell you not to Google, because I know that won't stop you. But I will say (a) limit the amount you do and (b) if you do Google, don't just search symptoms and match yours to whatever horrible thing comes up. Instead, look for evidence. Look for statistics in your age bracket. Look for ties to family history and hereditary links. And most of all, remind yourself that it's okay to get anxious, but it isn't okay to let that anxiety rule over you and ruin your day, week, month or existence.

Feelings are not facts.
Am I observing the situation accurately, or am I projecting how I feel onto what is happening?
Inhale courage, exhale anxiety.
We do not see things as they are, we see things as we are.
Mindfulness helps us get better at seeing the difference between what's happening and the stories we tell ourselves.
Make the distinction between a real problem and an imagined scenario that hasn't happened yet.
Don't believe every worried thought you have - worried thoughts are notoriously inaccurate.
Our greatest weapon against stress is the ability to choose one thought over another.
Feelings are much like waves; we can't stop them from coming, but we can decide which ones to surf.
Worrying won't stop bad things from happening, it just stops you from enjoying the good.
We either make ourselves miserable or we make ourselves strong, the amount of work is the same.
I will breathe. I will think of solutions. I will not let my worry control me. I will not let my stress break me. I will simply breathe. And it will be okay, because I don't quit.
I have managed this before, and I can manage it again.
I am present within myself. I can center myself with the ease of my breath. I feel grounded, confident, healthy, and whole.
With every breath, I release the anxiety within me and I become more and more calm.
You are not weak for needing time to sort through this.
Interrupt anxiety with gratitude.
I am choosing to believe that the future can still be beautiful. 
At the end of the day, we can endure much more than we think we can.
What we see depends mainly on what we look for.
The body benefits from movement, the mind benefits from stillness.
If it can be solved, there's no need to worry, and if it can't be solved, worry is of no use.
Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.
It is not necessary to react to everything you notice.
We are what we repeatedly do. What we dwell on is who we become.
Fear is a reaction, courage is a decision.
A bird sitting on a tree is never afraid of the branch breaking, because his trust is not in the branch, but in his own wings. 
99% of the things you worry about don't even happen.

I hope at least some of these resonate with you. I keep them in a list on my phone to reference when I'm struggling.

Anyway, I tend to think about it and get a chuckle when I see some posts on this sub. The truth is that if we go searching for something to worry about, we'll always find it.

199,2021-04-17T11:11:23+00:00,Mogwai_YT,A letter from a fellow Hypochondriac: ACCEPT YOUR ROLE,"Hi,
My name is Miguel, i'm a long time lurker of this subreddit. I originally joined for the same reason many of you did, to seek some comfort for my struggles with hypochondria.
I'm going to be completely honest here, I don't find this subreddit very helpful in it's current state. The way it operates though, makes perfect sense. This is what happens when you have a gathering of people suffering with health anxiety, you get posts from men and women who are seeking relief. Posts filled with fear, coming from someone who just wants somebody to tell them it's all going to be ok.
I'm a 31 year old male, and I consider myself to be a recovering hypochondriac. Meaning, while I do struggle with certain thought patterns every now and then (and always will, but we'll get to that later), I am in a much better position now than I was years ago. Today I decided i'm going to attempt to truly help most of you lurking here, by telling you what you need to hear. I could say the world is cruel, unfair and i'm just trying to make it a little bit less shitty by easing your suffering. Though one could say i'm just doing this for the purpose of self gratification, I don't believe both are incompatible. And quite frankly, who cares? I know YOU don't.
I'm going to start by giving you guys some context, by telling you about my story with hypochondria.
For me it began around 5 years ago, and while I certainly believe this is something that has always been within my mind, I have no doubt the catalyst was my regular use of Cannabis. Weed provided my life with many positive aspects. A boost in creativity, which benefited my job as a YouTuber. A source of motivation, since I would only smoke at night (1-3 joints) after a day of work, it was a great ""reward"" for me. It also helped me learn more about myself, by enhancing my self-awareness I was able to notice certain nasty aspects of my personality I have slowly but surely worked on since then (this is important for my job as a public figure, where unfortunately people's general perception of me can make or break my career).
Marijuana ended up becoming a double edged sword, though. It turns out, casual use of recreational cannabis has multiple beneficial effects, yet regular daily use for a long period of time will ALWAYS lead to negative results. Though the degree of this varies from person to person. For me it was pretty bad. At first it was the enhanced self-awareness. It's not hard to envision that becoming a problem with time, as it led to a point in which I was way too harsh on myself. The more aware I became of the many flaws within my personality, which manifested in my daily conduct, the more self deprecating I became. My body was also physically affected by the prolongued over estimulation of my endo cannabinoid system, people who enjoy Marijuana will try to deny this, but our endo cannabinoid system is not meant to be stimulated or ""lied to"" on a daily basis. I would start shaking every time I smoked a joint, feel nausea and that would only harm my mind even further.
I studied biology in college, and I since then i've had a fascination towards cellular biology (this includes genetics, biochemistry, etc). I became aware of the scary fact that the human body is comprised of TRILLIONS of cells. While this may just be ""fascinating"" to most, to me it was terrifying, and ultimately, this knowledge is where my health anxiety stems from.
Why is this frightening to me? Quite simply because this led me to a clear conclusion: I am a house that has no control over the very bricks which i'm made of.
This notion felt... unnacceptable to me. Here I am, a conscious being brought onto this world, and you're telling me that within my very essence, the concept of ""one"" is nothing but an illusion? I'm made of countless tiny pieces, and ANY of them could one day betray me? 
Fu**. Me.
As my weed induced paranoia grew, this perspective that I had developed over the course of my young adult life grew stronger and stronger, and that's when hell broke loose.
This was the genesis of my cancer phobia.
My first ""episode"" was a pericarditis I contracted in a castle in Warsaw, where I was working as a caster for an esports event. There was a viral outbreak (half of the crew got sick) and I felt lucky until I got back home and had pain in my heartbeat. From then onwards, things only got worse. I would reach the worst conclusion possible for every unpleasant symptom I felt.
Brain fog? Brain cancer.
Back pain? Spinal cancer.
Assymetrical clavicles? Bone cancer.
Discomfort in my abdomen while lying down? A tumor taking up space somewhere within.
Pupils of different sizes? Clearly a brain tumor.
I could go on and on.
I spent a couple of years going to the doctor every time I felt something was ""off"". Which was pretty much all the time hahaha
One day, I was walking outside and I saw this dog. It was running around in circles with the most genuine happy look in it's face and I remember thinking to myself... how I envy this idiot. A dog doesn't worry about the bricks it's comprised of. A dog doesn't know, a dog doesn't care. A dog can just focus on what they NEED to focus on, which is to find food, water and just enjoy life.
I sought help, reached out to a therapist who helped me to a degree which is hard to properly express. Not only did he teach me to ACCEPT these feelings, to accept fear in my life. He also pointed me in the right direction, so I could research the right sources and broaden my perspective on life.
You see, it turns out you are NOT the house. You are the consciousness emanating from a multicellular organism. You are the dance, your body is the dancer.
What i'm going to do now is help PUT YOU IN YOUR PLACE. Explain to you why you have no business reaching premature conclusions, no matter how TRUTHFUL THEY FEEL. ""It's all makes sense, my symptoms aline"".
Bullsh*t.
You are not your brain either. Like I said, you are the dance. What does this mean? Envision YOU as an individual in a room, sitting on a chair with a bunch of monitors in front of you. Those monitors are your thoughts. Your brain is constantly throwing them your way, yet that is all the brain is doing. YOU decide which screens, aka thoughts, you want to pay attention to.
People like us spend most of the day staring at the same screen. The negative health thoughts. We feel some kind of weird symptom (which is 99.9% of the time caused by the damage your body takes from being in a constant state of stress by the way) and spend our entire day staring at that monitor. I know what you just focused on in that last phrase, don't you think I don't. ""What about the 0.1% of the time""? Shut up. Stop. You are not the 0.1% and deep down you know this.
So what do I do?
You don't step out of the hypochondria loop by fully ignoring these thoughts either. You embrace your role as the person in the room filled with monitors. You see the thought, you acknowledge it and then you focus your attention on another screen. You do this as many times as you need to. Never deny the presence of theses thoughts, just nod and then focus on something else. Something that will be more worthy of your time. 
I said earlier that it is not your place to focus on these sorts of thoughts. I say this because it is completely and utterly pointless. Your brain carries an amigdala with an archaic design, if compared to your frontal cortex. This part of your brain DOES NOT UNDERSTAND hypochondriac thoughts and obsessions. This part of the brain only understands one thing: THERE IS A THREAT.
What does it do in the face of such a threat? It releases a bunch of harmful chemicals onto your blood stream that enhance certain physical traits, at the expense of physiological self harm. These chemicals cause ALL KINDS of crazy symptoms. For me some of them include: red dots on my hands accompanied with a sensation similar to that of having a bunch of needles poking at them, numbness on the left side of my face, vertigo, dizziness, feeling as though i'm running out of air, sweaty hands, nausea, brain fog, tension headaches, feeling of weakness in my legs, ringing in my ears, stomach pain, rib pain, the sensation that i'm going to faint at any given moment, and a loooong etc.
Theses side effects only enhance your fears, your sense of doom. This triggers the amigdala even further and there you have it: and endless cycle of physical and mental suffering that never seems to end. 
Hell.
I'm going to help you, the dance, understand your role in life, in regards to the rest of your body. 
Just as your lungs provide you with oxygen, your heart pumps blood, your stomach dissolves food and your kidneys filter out toxic waste, you, the consciouness have certain duties assigned to you.
In order to help keep the organism functioning, you have to find and consume food and water, and then mate. 
That's it. Well, that would be it for most animals, but our brains have evolved to a degree to which, thanks to our ever growing knowledge, we are capable of controlling more.
Hygiene, smart dieting, exercise to keep the muscles active and encourage development are amongst many things we can do to improve our quality of life. There's more to that though, as a conscious entity, we are here to EXPERIENCE the world around us. To find the intrigue and joy within this planet, to learn, to teach, to provide for others as you provide for yourself.
This is your place. 
Controlling your cells so that they don't rebel, that is not your place. That job is up to your immune system, who will ALWAYS do a much better job at it than any doctor in the planet. Doctors are there to HELP your body keep you going. They are aides. It is up to your own organism to keep you alive, because like you that is what your entire body DESIRES.
TRUST your body. It is orders of magnitude more resilient, effective and intelligent than you think it is.
By letting negative thoughts take over your life, you are SABOTAGING YOURSELF. You are only making it more difficult for your organism to function like it's supposed to, and you are effectively dying of worry over something that is completely out of your control.
There are some benefits to HAVING BEEN a hypochondriac. You are more sensitive to unpleasant corporal symptoms. This means that once you get over yourself trying to control everything and just LET GO, whenever there is something that truly needs to be looked at, you'll have an easier time ""noticing"" compared to others.
What they don't tell you about many terminal diseases is that many people affected by them go on to ignore really scary symptoms for a long period of time. We all know that if anybody here ever sees BUT A DROP of blood in their toilet, they are in the ER within 15 minutes. Believe it or not a lot of people go on years without even paying attention to stuff like this.
Unless you are genetically predisposed to a certain disease, odds of you having a heart attack for example before 45 are pretty much zero. Again, your body is TOUGH. Think about all the people who spend years destroying themselves with hardcore drugs, only to recover and end up living long lives.
Some day, you will get truly ill, and you will die. It will happen to every single human being on this planet. That being the case, is it truly such a terrible thing? We are all connected by fate. We don't know what happens afterwards, but going back to where we came from, cannot possibly be such a bad destiny if you ask me.
BREATHE. Look at the world around you, how amazing the fact that we are even here to begin with is. Make use of your time, fulfill YOUR ROLE as the consciousness, LET GO and trust your body to fulfill theirs.
Be like that dog running around smiling, be happy with your role. 
Embrace it. Your organs will embrace theirs, for as long as they can.
You are not alone, and you never truly will be.
Love,
A fellow hypochondriac.",126,Create an account,https://old.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/msotj2/a_letter_from_a_fellow_hypochondriac_accept_your/,,,,,1,2183,42.22,64.17,77.89,23.71,14.85,6.05,3.02,2.75,2.02,0.5,1.42,0.64,0.09,0,0.23,11.59,2.75,0.6,0.14,0.18,0.27,0.78,8.34,0,0.05,0.05,0.23,0.09,0,0,0.09,1.83,0.27,0.23,0.92,0.37,0.09,5.27,2.47,0.92,0.05,0.55,0.27,0,0.18,0.09,0.27,0.18,0.64,0.09,0.27,0.09,4.31,3.21,6.41,1.79,16.67,6.41,5.77,0.64,0,1.83,2.02,0

205,2021-07-20T09:30:39+00:00,Deep_Distribution985,I had a colonoscopy today,"In my ongoing saga that started here: https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/m5yfz1/im_really_struggling_with_colon_cancer_worries/
Quick rundown:
35 white male with on/off rectal bleeding since I was 19. Blood is usually bright red (sometimes appears maroon) and is often visible on the toilet paper, dripping into the bowl following a bowel movement, and/or coating/streaking the stool.
In February 2020, had a particularly painful bowel movement and since then have been experiencing varying degrees of bleeding plus pain. (Initially, pain was with each bowel movement, and now it usually presents more like burning/itching for a couple hours following.)
In February 2021, experienced a round of bleeding that suddenly triggered my health anxiety. I developed the following symptoms in addition to bleeding:

Abdominal pain/cramping/vague discomfort
More frequent stools (going from once every day to multiple times a day)
Loose stools
Thinner stools
Change in stool color (yellow, orange)
Passing mucus with stool
More frequent diarrhea, occasionally bloody
Loss of appetite
Weight loss (10 lbs. in a week)

All signs seemed to point to colon cancer.
SPOILERS: I do not have colon cancer.
After months of waiting, months of worrying, months of Googling and reading Reddit posts and scouring this subreddit (plus other subreddits, like the colon cancer and cancer subreddits), I finally had my colonoscopy today. The prep, while unpleasant, was pretty straightforward to deal with. The procedure itself was a breeze. What I was really nervous for were the results. I was in tears multiple times this past week worrying about what I’d find out. I almost started crying as I left my wife to go into the prep area today. What were they going to tell me when I woke up?
Well… I have hemorrhoids. I also have two large growths near my rectum called multilobed hypertrophic anal papillae, which are essentially skin tags that developed as a result of chronic fissures. The doc biopsied them to check for infection, and he also biopsied my colon in multiple areas to check for microscopic colitis, but his words: “Otherwise, things looks pretty normal. Nothing looks like cancer.”
That’s it. No cancer. Not even a polyp. I lost my mind to worry for half a year because of some hemorrhoids and skin tags. Every single reassuring post helped inch me closer to rationality, but every horror story about “I was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer and I HAD NO SYMPTOMS at 29 years old” brought me crashing back down. I convinced myself I was going to be a statistic.
Well don’t I feel silly…
Anyway, I hope this helps reassure someone, but having been in your shoes, the best thing you can do is treat your anxiety. I wasted so much time letting Google and the horror stories rule my life—it was wholly unproductive. The only good thing that came out of all that worrying was focusing more on treating my anxiety. I’m on Buspirone now, and I feel so much different, so much better, than I have before. The colonoscopy was my last step, and I’m glad I did it, but I’m more glad that I’m on an actual treatment path for the underlying anxiety. I couldn’t keep living that way.
Best of luck to all.

One year ago, my health anxiety and accompanying paranoia was so bad that at one point I was absolutely convinced that I had roaches crawling in my ears at night, that I would succumb to anaphylaxis (no known allergies) and that I would be electrocuted in the shower. It was crushing my life. 
I’m here to tell you that you are NOT alone in your fight to regain control of your life. And it IS possible to overcome. 
Some things to keep in mind:

The human body is very resilient. It will unmistakably tell you in a number of ways if it is seriously compromised. Not every little ache and pain is worthy of a trip to the doctor. 
DO NOT GOOGLE. One more time for the people in the back: no googling! Seriously. Listen to your body, not WebMD. 
Be upfront with yourself about your anxiety. When you want to let your anxiety consume your mind, you need to make a conscious effort to remove yourself from the situation. Take a walk, play with your dog, call a friend. Get your mind off of it ASAP. 
Face your fears. This one is tried and true. 
Know that you are not crazy. You are not the first person to have these thoughts, and it is possible to recover. 
Pick up a new healthy hobby to occupy your mind. Think: cooking, meditation, yoga, painting, etc. 
Death is something that has to happen to all of us, and each of our days will come. Instead of worrying about it every day, remind yourself that you need to actually enjoy the ride while you’re here!

After suffering though multiple health scares (brain cancer, MS, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, diabetes, esophageal cancer, and more), you’d think I would have been able to recognize the pattern. Every time I was cleared by my doctor and told that I was healthy, I would ultimately conjure up a new worry. 
———————————
Earlier this year I started seeing a therapist because I wanted to confide in someone about this “illness” and gain the strength to finally make a doctor’s appointment, get an official diagnosis, break this terrible news to my family, and start to cope with the fact that I was dying at the age of 32.
Something very different happened. We talked about my childhood. My alcoholic parents. My abusive step-father. The absence of my real father. Neglect. Depression. Isolation. And she also encouraged me to make the damn doctor’s appointment!
Terrified was an understatement. The days leading up to my appointment, I couldn’t eat, couldn’t sleep, or even pay attention at work. It was sheer torture.
One very long week after my appointment, I got a call from my doctor’s office. I saw the number come through on my cell phone: “Dr. Garner.” My heart sank. I sat down, took a deep breath, and braced myself for “THE news.”
“Hello, Amy. We have the results of your lab work.”
OH, SHIT.
“Your kidney function was normal. Thyroid, sugars, B12, cholesterol was also normal. We will see you back in one year. Have a nice day.”
I wasn’t dying. Again.
———————————
Flash forward to 8 months later. I am still in therapy and now have the tools and support to manage my HA. Yes I still struggle daily, especially during a global pandemic. But now if I have a genuine concern, I don’t sit with it for months or years...I deal with it immediately and put those fears to bed.
So I wrote all this to say that I made a huge huge step today. I scheduled a preconception visit with my OB/GYN. I never thought I’d be healthy enough to have a baby, let alone live long enough to raise a child. My hubs and I are elated!

If you have the urge to Google a symptom that has cropped up, add 'from anxiety' at the end of the symptom when you Google it. For example, ""overactive bladder from anxiety"" or ""muscle spasms from anxiety""
If you're in a state of anxiety, the chances are high that your symptom is caused by anxiety, by adding this to your search you will find quick reassurance instead of ""you have terminal cancer and/or motor neuron disease""",119,Create an account,https://old.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/lwqvis/anxious_about_a_symptom_follow_this_advice_before/,,,,,1,106,72.96,90.5,14.39,1,26.5,8.49,1.89,6.6,6.6,0,6.6,6.6,0,0,0,12.26,4.72,1.89,0,0,0,1.89,7.55,0,0,0,0,2.83,0,0,2.83,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.43,6.6,1.89,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.94,0,0,0,0,4.72,0.94,4.72,0.94,16.04,1.89,3.77,0.94,0,2.83,6.6,0

215,2020-09-03T09:44:11+00:00,onhappypills,Health Anxiety. A morning in the life (for me),"I wake up. Man, my neck is sore. Can i move my head? Can my chin touch my chest? If not then i have meningitis which will no doubt kill me. I wonder if it has a high survival rate? Anyway no googling.
I stand up and stretch. Are my knees aching more than usual? Did they hurt this much yesterday? Anyway try not to think about it. I brush my teeth. Blood on the brush. Huh, I wonder how long it will be until this gum disease causes all of my gums to recede completely and I am left toothless with even less confidence than i have already. Anyway, i can't get into a dentist so don't dwell on negatives and move on.
I sit on the toilet. Is everything OK down there? Was that bump there yesterday? How about that bit? Oh god Im sure i just felt a lump. Anyway, its getting sore now I'll leave it. I wipe and stand up. 
Oh my god is that blood in my poop? Thats it. I'm done. I either have stomach cancer or bleeding stomach ulcers and have hours to live, I know this because the blood is dark, and not fresh. After spreading my stool around and examining at length i realised that i ate beetroot yesterday and was probably that.
I hop in the shower. Oh god has this been cleaned recently? It smells like it has. With what!? Whatever it is i am breathing this stuff in right now and it will permanently damage my lungs. After the shampoo almost blinds me. Can i still breathe? I can't take as deep of a breath as i normally can. Thats it for me. 
Wait, I need to pee again already? Frequent urination is definitely bowel cancer and that is a quick way to go out. Anyways, not that i have all of those worries weighing heavily on my mind, time to head to work.

218,2021-08-17T15:09:43+00:00,popeupinyagrill,HEALTH ANXIETY SUCKS... BUT IT GET'S EASIER. TRIGGER WARNING,"Hi, I have had health anxiety for around 3 years and I know the feeling. It consumes your life. Every waking minute is a constant ""What If"" Scenario. I have made my own life and the life of those around me a misery and It's unrelenting! However, These are the things that took the edge for me (Baring in mind I still have awful weeks) But overall I am less worried all the time. 

DO NOT GOOGLE SYMPTOMS - This is a NO BRAINER, Googling symptoms will make you aware of diseases and ailments that kill 1/1000000000000 Per year and us (Being Hypochondriacs) Will convince ourselves we have this rare disease. I once convinced myself I had a brain eating Amoeba from doing a Neti Pot....... See.

Seek medical help or at the very least speak to a professional who can give you some anxiety reducing medication.Many with Health anxiety have OCD tendencies and without assistance in coping with these obsessive thought patterns beating Health anxiety is a lot harder.

Eat healthy AF! This in turn will make you feel better, make you sleep better and also make the one thing you don't trust (Your body) Work better. Then this will restore your faith in your bodies ability to look after itself.

4.STAY BUSY!! I don't care if your jobless, homeless, on drugs or a serial killer with health anxiety. You have to stay busy! Rumination is the first step to obsession.

Play the odds game. What I mean is look at the odds of you having said particular lines/disease etc. I know its almost impossible but this really does help.
F**K ""WHAT IF?!"" This is the one thing I still struggle with now. ""What If I am the 1 in 98636466672527252278263436 people that gets a brain eating amoeba?!"" "" WHAT IF I do have an undiagnosed condition that all the doctors (Possibly around 40) At this point have missed""? ""What if Google is somehow more knowledgeable than a trained medical professional who has trained for like seven years ?!"" ""WHAT IF I am in fact going to die soon?!""This question is like saying what if you were born as a snail? It's completely pointless and will not play any hand in helping you or making you happy.
STOP CHECKING YOUR BODY FOR LUMPS/BUMPS & OR SENSATIONS. The mind is amazing at becoming sensitive to particular things if you focus on it enough. If you notice a headache, don't immediately jump on Dr Google and start searching because according to DR Google you are in fact dying from a brain tumour.... You are not. It is a headache and the more you worry about it the longer it will persist. Anxiety attributes to SOOOOO many bodily sensations and ""Symptoms"" It's unreal! So please, give yourself a 5 minute window (If you really must check your body) But DO NOT check outside of the window. I mean, how likely is the symptom or lump or bump going to change from when you checked it in your window? Not much. If you do have something that is particularly worrying you then Go to a doctor, but when he/she tells you that you are probably fine, BELIEVE THEM!!
Remember that Medical professionals know A LOT more about medical things than Google does. Or more specifically, They know what to look for when it comes to you as an individual. An example, I have always had bad posture and a sore back because I am tall and have so many sports injuries its unreal. I have seen so many physios and doctors who all blame my bad posture and this for my sore neck and headaches (Which is true) .But I being a health Anxiety sufferer instead believed it was MS or osteoporosis and drove myself insane obsessing and doubting the professionals diagnosis. 
STOP SEEKING REASSURANCE FROM NON PROFESSIONALS. This is a tough one to stop. I still struggle so much with this one because the brief reassurance you get in the midst of terrible health anxiety episode is so nice. For a very short time you think ""Maybe they are right"". Then after 4 seconds your anxiety hat goes back on and it does nothing to reassure you at all. So basically, It's completely pointless to seek reassurance from friends or family because unless they are doctors and have the tools to perform copies amounts of tests you will not believe them. Instead, If yo are worried about something go to the doctors and get tests done. When they come back normal, believe the tests and move on. 

​

This is not permanent. I can promise you that you will one day get over being so obsessed over your own health. It might take months, years or decades but you will win. How do I know? I was pretty much housebound for two years due to my irrational fear of me just dropping to the floor with a brain aneurysm. I barely saw friends or family and often called in work sick because I was so worried. Now, I am still anxious as I am just a worrying kinda guy but after being put on Sertraline, changing my diet, exercising and staying busy my health anxiety has took a back seat. It's still there but I AM THE ONE NOW DRIVING. Before my Health anxiety was driving the car and I was a mere passenger. My goal is to one day have my health anxiety a few cars back stuck in traffic. You can do it but all it takes is belief, hard work and self love.

​
Much Love

221,2020-10-10T05:34:50+00:00,throwaway117296,How do you *not* have health anxiety as a struggling American in the US?,"TLDR: don't see how you can't have health anxiety in a for profit medical system that will abuse and mistreat you then throw you in debt.    
I was a tough kid. I worked hard labor when I wasn't in school. I laughed at pain and was a daredevil.       
My naive young self always thought no matter what happened to my health, if it got to a point I couldn't work then I would be taken care of. After all, we are in a first world country and being the type that would push myself until I collapse, it should be a no-brainer that I would qualify for help should something happen.  I felt safe and was blissfully ignorant.          
Then I got older and realized health insurance is ridiculously expensive. Ok then, at least I'd still get amazing care should something happen, but stopped being adventurous because that's just being frivolous with money at that point.             
Then as an adult I got sick. Really really sick. Doctors didn't really seem concerned. I was pissing blood, pale, high fever,.. they gave me some antibiotics and 2 days off work. I came into work still sick, and collapsed. ER told me I fainted from low blood pressure. They didn't give me any fluids just told me to follow up with my dr.
I still had to go back to work the next day, as they didn't give me time off and my dr appointment was 3 days later.   
Dr basically told me to suck it up and drink more water. Alright then. The fevers and blood pissing eventually stopped but I started fainting randomly and going into convulsions. Once again shrugs from doctors. 
I was scared I was dying. Constantly dizzy, fainting, severe abdominal pains, and was in a huge amount of debt with doctors that didn't want to breathe in my general direction so I started getting anxiety and depression.      
I thought maybe if I brought up how this is now causing panic attacks they would take it more seriously. They tried to give me ssris but it just made it 100x worse  to where I was going to lose my job. I asked them if they could just help me figure the problem out as my anxiety stems from their apathy and they ended up using my GAD diagnosis to explain everything that's happened in the past. I started to believe them, after all they're doctors ""do no harm"". Made myself actually go crazy thinking I was doing this for attention or from stress.     
I remember sliding down my wall at home and just sitting on the floor in shock. It finally hit me. The realization of how everything runs here, and the social safety net that doesn't actually exist. Our medical system painted in gold but rotten on the inside.     
I'm just glad the pandemic has shown some light on how unstable the quality of care is here. Hope others that just realized this know it's always been this way and now their walls they were hiding behind are down.",121,Create an account,https://old.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/j8f1du/how_do_you_not_have_health_anxiety_as_a/,,,,,1,524,16.17,4.59,97.35,1,14.97,8.59,2.29,5.92,4.2,0.95,2.86,1.53,0,0.19,0.38,8.78,4.2,0.95,0.38,0.19,0.57,1.34,4.2,0,0,0,0,0.57,0.38,0.19,0,3.82,0,0.19,2.67,1.15,0,7.44,5.73,2.86,0,0.57,0,0,0.19,0.19,0.38,0.38,1.34,0,0,0,6.68,8.4,3.82,1.15,13.93,6.87,2.86,0.19,0,2.86,1.15,0
222,2021-09-19T15:29:31+00:00,TheScreecher187,Anxiety Over Heart Health,"The past week or two I have been real anxious over my heart health, On the fourth of this month around 4AM I had felt this sort of chest pressure and the first thought was ""Shit! This is a heart attack"" it spread to my left arm and felt a bit of jaw pressure so I woke up my dad and called 911 ASAP. The ambulance arrived and they hooked me on the EKG and saw my blood pressure and said everything looked normal and it most likely was just anxiety, that I shouldn't worry because I am pretty young at 22 years old. Ever since then these types of panic attacks started to become more apparent and terrified me everytime since I was scared I'd drop dead. Sometimes I also get real dizzy, and one day it got so bad I went to the hospital to make sure everything is alright and once again the EKG and blood (both pressure and sugar) came out normal. The next few days I went to my doctor and he checked up on me and said everything sounded normal. But the thought in my head was still that they might have missed something, I am pretty obese and am now working on lowering my weight and changing to a more healthier diet. But sometimes my anxiety gets so bad I am CONVINCED something is wrong, I get brief moments of vertigo that comes and goes that is enough to make me jump and convince myself that I am dying. I linked so many things to heart health that I am worrying family members. I got another major attack this thursday that made me call 911 AGAIN and once again everything came out fine, I still get anxiety attacks and feel heart attack symptoms sometimes but I know the road to a full mental recovery will take a bit of time. But man feeling this anxious all the time just sucks! 😅

Let me guess. Most (if not) all of you think that you are a rare case of cancer or other illness that goes unnoticed no matter how many times you've went to doctors and experts. 
You think that this weird stomach pain is surely intestinal cancer that masks like IBS or a cold. 
You think that this headache combined with shoulder pain is brain tumor and totally not bad posture 
You think that although you are strong and seemingly healthy, you have a SINISTER tumor growing without you knowing
All that make you feel that suddenly and without warning you will get bad news about terminal illnesses that will destroy you.
So, doesn't that show us that we got anxious and believed that we can be the same case as the X person who sneezed and said it's a cold and it was omega cancer 2000? Haven't we all heard stories from/about relatives about poor uncle Timmy who had a headache and in two days they found him looking like a pile of dry shit on his bed and they found out he had a rare cancer in his armpit?
I know I had. I was RAISED in this environment. My grandma and mother and almost everyone talked about that crap. And then came the internet with comments and videos and articles about all the above and us getting panicked that we have or will have the same because we were conditioned to believe that it's around the corner.
Is it though? Or is it just us acting like dumb fucks who generalized over exaggerated/poorly communicated/fake cases?",118,Create an account,https://old.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/m0mcr2/how_many_of_you_think_that_stupid_horror_health/,,,,,1,291,12.69,91.19,48.18,1,22.38,7.56,1.03,5.5,3.44,0,2.75,1.03,0,0,1.03,16.15,3.44,0,0,0,1.03,2.06,12.71,1.37,0,0.69,1.72,0.34,0,0,0.34,0.69,0,0.34,0.34,0,0,7.9,5.84,4.47,0.34,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.03,0,0,0,2.06,5.15,4.47,1.03,8.59,2.75,0.69,1.72,0,1.72,1.72,0

226,2020-05-09T15:23:21+00:00,Kidfromtha650,Advice from a cancer survivor and nurse,"Hi there. 
I’ve seen this sub a lot from people who frequently come to my cancer’s sub (which is a support group lol please don’t come there asking for us to diagnose you.) 
I am a graduate nurse with a background in the ER as well as a stage 2 unfavorable Hodgkin’s Lymphoma survivor. 
I know that health anxiety is a really serious obstacle to overcome, and I just want to offer some reassurance from both a patient and provider standpoint. 
First off, let me start by saying that bad things do happen. Obviously-I got a rare cancer. However, a lot of the things that may seem absolutely detrimental to you are actually not too big of a deal. 
I’ve seen people stressed about food poisoning from eating something strange, racing heart rates, thyroid issues, and even cancer. As a cancer survivor and someone in poor health, I am here to say that these things aren’t that bad. Even cancer isn’t too terrible. Yes, it sucked, but I saw someone say that they would immediately kill themselves if they had cancer. That’s a bit extreme considering the fact that most cancers are pretty treatable even in the most advanced stages, so why jump the gun there? Of course, you already know that Dr. Google will give you a death sentence immediately. However, the real world isn’t like that. 
From a medical professional standpoint, it’s also important to remember how resilient bodies are made to be. Eating a piece of food that wasn’t perfectly cooked will likely not harm you at all. If anything, you’ll spend a couple of hours in the bathroom. Your body has a superb immune system made to fight off things that come into your body and don’t belong there. That’s why you get symptoms from viruses (fevers actually make an environment that make it hard for bacteria and viruses to survive.) The lymphatic system is an amazing thing, and swelling of lymph nodes is reassuring that it’s working! Your lymph nodes work like a filtering sponge, so they clean anything and everything that doesn’t belong inside of you! Having a swollen one is typically a sign that your body is preventing you from getting sick, as it’s filled with lymph fluid that is cleaning your blood. 
With that being said, I think it’s helpful to consider variations as well. Vital signs, for example, may differ from person to person. For example, my husband, an extremely active person, has a heart rate that hangs out in the 40s and 50s. It’s normal for him. Mine hangs out higher since I’m not anywhere near as active. Temperatures also fluctuate. Everyone wants to hear 98.6 as their temp, but that’s just not realistic. Your body has to adapt to the environment around it (it’s called homeostasis) to keep everything working well inside. Temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure work to compensate for any variation of your environment! Obviously extremely abnormal vitals should be monitored, but very few people are actually in that perfect range. 
Another facet of variation comes in with people’s anatomy. I have a fat pad in my armpit (not cancer- it would have shown up on my PET scan.) my friends don’t have this fatty tissue, but that doesn’t mean it’s a bad thing. It’s just something that my body did. My husband has a small dent in his sternum, which is just something about his body (lots of people have them and they’re not a big deal). 
My point here is that anatomical differences and vital sign variations exist for reasons that we may not understand. My other point is that your worst case scenario may not actually be that bad if it comes true. 
I hope this is helpful for at least one person. I will not be answering questions about my medical history or giving out medical advice considering the fact that I think it would be counter-productive to this post.",119,Create an account,https://old.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/ggh96l/advice_from_a_cancer_survivor_and_nurse/,,,,,1,665,25.09,34.91,40.84,28.25,16.22,5.71,3.16,2.56,1.5,0.3,1.2,0.3,0,0,0,10.38,3.31,1.05,0.3,0.3,0,1.5,7.07,0.3,0.15,0,0.75,0.15,0,0,0.15,1.5,0,0,1.2,0.3,0,9.32,6.32,2.56,0.3,0,0,0,0.9,0.3,0.6,0.45,0.45,0.3,0.15,0,1.35,2.71,7.22,1.8,16.99,5.86,4.36,0.15,0.45,4.21,1.95,0
227,2020-10-29T04:46:35+00:00,rokitbanana2,Health anxiety about bowel + colon cancer (SUPPORT),"I felt the need to write this post to support anybody who is going through a tough time over this. There will be 3 things I want to talk about and I hope you take on what I have to say as I’ve went through a very hard time so hopefully you don’t have to! Sorry for the VERY long post!!
PLEASE READ LAST DOT POINTS TOO!
Symptoms:
I am 22 years old and had ongoing rectal bleeding, flat stools and the occasional stomach pain for the past 2 years. It was progressively getting better but just wouldn’t complete go away. It was always bright red but regardless of colour seeing blood on the toilet paper is always unsettling. I tend to have sore lower backs (also a symptom apparently) and would have bowel cramps every so often. 
Anxiety and self diagnosis:
I convinced myself it was colon cancer and it made the last year and a half a literal living hell. Every decision I made was influenced by this and it took away real joy from my life for that entire time. I wasted my 22nd birthday and many other important memories over this. It was a vicious cycle of seeking reassurance off reddit, loved ones and medical professionals. Daily self talking, questioning and worrying. All I ever seemed to do was look for the negative in my symptoms. I’d always find a way to attract the worst possible outcome. I also had a friend my age who was disgnosed with colon cancer, even though our symptoms were different (he lost A LOT of weight) I still kept comparing him to me. No matter whether my symptoms were improving or not, the uncertainty always pushed me to breaking point. There is so much more to say on this topic and health anxiety behaviours, message me if you need to talk through it. 
Diagnosis + procedure:
Even though I was told numerous times by doctors, specialists and family that I was 99% going to not have cancer, I’d already convinced myself otherwise. I had a conference call with a gastro specialist (due to covid) and was told based on my symptoms (listed above) and my age that this was 99% hemorrhoids, but they’d need to scope just in case there’s anything else. This “anything else” was something my anxiety played on, I was not confident enough to get the procedure so I saw my doctor. My doctor gave me a physical (finger) exam and found a couple hemmorhoids. I should’ve been relieved right? Yes and no. I was relieved for a day or so then the anxiety returned (as it always will if you don’t seek help!!) and thought what if there’s something else in my bowel too. My physiotherapist I visited told me I had a tight pelvic floor (causing thin stools). But Nothing would ease me until I had complete reassurance, so a rough 6 months later I decided to finally get the procedure done. I was told I needed to band my hemmorhoids (if any are found) and a colonoscopy to check for anything else. The procedure was in 2 weeks and my life was living hell until then. I walked around like I was on death row, expecting nothing but a BAD DIAGNOSIS. I know a lot of you are only here to read my symptoms and diagnosis for that temporary reassurance, but PLEASE read my diagnosis and ONWARDS because it’s your only way out of this vicious health anxiety cycle! The colonoscopy prep kinda sucked, I was really hungry but I got through it and actually felt nice to empty my bowels completely. It did cause slight bleeding due to the amount of bowel movements. The actual procedure was the easiest part (a part from the crippling anxiety). It was a breeze, I was put to sleep and it felt like one second later I was awake. I’d never been put under anaesthetic before so i was expecting a lot worse than that, dare I say the sleep was great haha! (If you have any questions about the procedure hit me up!) I woke up, I was seated and I kept over hearing everybody else get their results. A year and a half of anxiety lead to this moment. I kept wondering why are they stalling on my results? Am I sick and they’re preparing to tell me? Anyway, I’m happy to say that was the last IRRATIONAL thought I ever had on the subject of bowel cancer. I was told they banded three hemorrhoids and found no cancers or polyps. 
Please read this next part, it’s crucial. 
My advice is probably not going to be what you want to hear. But if you are like myself, and tend to have health anxiety episodes, this was my experience and I hope it helps you find the courage to do the same.

If you are endlessly scrolling through reddit and other health forums trying to look for reassurance, stop. It is single handedly the worst way to go about this. All this will do will make a 1% chance feel like your inevitable reality. It’s like putting a mental magnifying glass on the 1% chance, and completely warping your own minds sense of ACTUAL reality! 
Seek help, therapy. I’ve put this before getting scoped as it turned out to be the real issue here for me. My therapist helped me realise I’m fearful of what I cannot control and having too much time on my hands has allowed me the time and energy to really focus on health issues. Therapy has helped my health anxiety and I feel I’m overcoming it more and more everyday . Everybody’s mental reasoning will be different but what I know is that regardless the reason talking about it can only help. Also try get a routine going and keep busy, it could help you too!
Get scoped, chances are this will make everything seem so much more real but please let me tell you it’s okay. You’ll get through it and I’m sure you’ll be fine just like I was. 99% you will be fine actually! Even if they do find something (any abnormality, not just cancer) that is important as it’s better to get on top of it issues early! Especially if you’re around my age, even if the stars align something is found it’ll be very early stage so they’ll just remove it and you’ll get through it! So mentally and physically there’s no reason to stall! By the way I know you felt anxious when I said “even if there is something” ... classic health anxiety.

I always told my self during that dreadful time that I’d come back to reddit and tell my story. Ironically to get other anxious people OFF reddit (symptom searching) and improving their mental and physical health. Searching symptoms is a strong symptom of health ANXIETY so you should be just as concerned about that as you are physical illness symptoms! 
I hope this helps in any way at all, if you have any questions or you just need to talk to someone message me or reply to this thread!

228,2019-01-18T15:47:25+00:00,Mrsparker9619,How I overcame health anxiety (read this is your currently struggling),"So, i have been wanting to post this here but have been putting it off because this is going to be long so bare with me. If you want to know how I over came this bad disease keep reading, If your ready to recover keep reading. 
It all started when I was 16. Nothing necessarily trigger this other then I got sick one time (fever, body aches), and it had been a few years since I had a check up when my mom said “you need to let me take you to the doctor for a check up because you won’t know if somethings wrong of you don’t”. So when I got sick I decided to google it to see what was wrong, and leukemia was the first thing that popped up. My heart dropped. From that moment I was a google fanatic and thought I had every disease in the book. I suddenly started experiencing symptoms of leukemia like fatigue, and flu like symptoms. 
The after that I was worried I had a brain tumor. I had symptoms of that also, this was the worst one for me I think. I had a buzzing noise in my ear from time to time, blurred vision, fuzzy peripheral vision, headaches, pressure on the top of my head, slurred speech sometimes, nausea at time, etc. it was HORRIBLE. The symptoms were real. I was checked multiple times and I got a clean bill of health. 
Then I worried about skin cancer. I seen a dermatologist who confirmed I do NOT have skin cancer. 
I then found what I thought to be a lump in my abdomen and seen a doctor who said it’s nothing but she ordered a CT with contrast to shut me up. That was clear as well BUT did say I had a very slightly enlarged spleen which could have been caused by mono when I was younger. 
I had many blood panels, EKGS, echocardiograms, CT scans, X-rays, urine tests, I saw a chiropractor, a dermatologist, and many MDs before I finally decided to accept that this was a mental issue and I’m NOT ill. It took me 5 long frustrating, scary, years before I agreed I had an issue with worrying over my health for no good reason. I seen two counselors and they helped, but I knew the change had to be within me! 
I finally accepted the facts. Google is not the most reliable source. In fact, only 42% of the health info found on google IS accurate. So your pretty much seeking reassurance from a uneducated stranger rather then just seeing your dr and trusting their diagnosis. It’s hard to agree these symptoms are in your head, but they ARE! You can make yourself feel all sorts of crazy symptoms, so if you’ve seen a doctor and you have a good report, the only thing you should be googling is Health Anxiety symptoms and making sure your on a reliable website, such as webMD or Mayoclinic. Steer clear of yahoo answers, or any of the other forums that uneducated people  post on trying to give advice. In facts, steer clear of google and the web PERIOD! 
Here’s how I done it:
I scheduled a check up and wrote down ALL of my concerns. I talked to my doctor about my issues with anxiety and how bad I was making myself worry. He told me I need to stay FAR AWAY from google all together and I followed his orders. I had him do a full check up, ekg, blood work, STD testing, you name it just to at last, put my mind at ease. Once that was over and I was confirmed healthy, I started finding stuff to do like working out, surrounding myself with friends, and I got a job! I would leave my phone in the car locked up when I went into work. For a period of time I only used my phone for calls and texts. When i did have the urge to google I’d find something else to do. Like go for a walk and talk to myself about all the tests I’ve had. After ALL of these test, it would be very unlikely something so sinister would be missed! I knew it was mental so I would be easy on myself. Cry if need be. But don’t check for lumps, don’t start Letting your mind wonder, keep yourself occupied at least for the first few weeks. I would set new goals for myself (like school, work, gym). Find someone you trust and talk to them about your problems. Like for me, it was my mother. Work on IMPROVING your health. Eat healthy, get enough sleep, get a good amount of exercise each week, and take a supplement. And most of all remind yourself this is a mental thing when you start to worry and IMMEDIATELY distract yourself. Please keep in mind this is a process, it didn’t get this bad over night so it will not be fixed over night, it will take time. Be patient with yourself. Talk to a counselor if you need to. 
🛑STOP POSTING QUESTIONS LOOKING FOR ANSWERS! 🛑 because you won’t find them here, unless your looking for ways to over come anxiety. 
If you believe in God, pray often. If you need medication, take it.
Personally I never wanted meds because I don’t want to be dependent on them. But if it helps you, take it. If you need a break from work. Take it. Put you first. 
If your scared to see a doctor make the appointment and MAKE yourself go for reassurance. Remember, if (god forbid) something is wrong, It’s better to find out  and take care of it then ignore it and it get worse (like, high blood pressure for instance, if you don’t take meds it can potentially eventually damage arteries) but it’s better to fix the problem and move on then to not do anything at all. But no matter what Google is not the answer. 
If anyone needs to talk or has questions feel free to ask me! I am pretty educated in the health field as I’ve done many years of research as well as school
For registered nursing. I have family in the medical field, so if you feel you need to confide in someone don’t hesitate to DM me and we can work though this together, I don’t want to see anyone waste years of their life like I did if I can help it!

Brain fog
Visual disturbances (floaters/fuzz/flashing lights) 
Paresthesia (tingling or numb limbs) 
Feeling off-balance (like I’m walking on a boat) 
Ringing in my ears 
& CONSTANT ANXIETY (YAY!) 

This has all culminated in a health anxiety obsession. I thought I had a variety of illness from MS (I swear everyone here diagnoses themselves with this) to brain cancer, to whatever and had every test under the sun. EKG, Blood Tests, Brain MRI, Spine MRI, EMG, Nerve Conduction Tests and today, an Eye Exam…
The kicker… EVERYTHING CAME BACK HEALTHY. even the eye doctor today was saying I had some of the healthiest eyes she’s seen. ugh. I just want these symptoms to stop. I workout daily, take care of myself, and trying to enjoy life; but it keeps on happening. 
If anyone has any advice or knows of any anxiety meds that help them through this, please let me know. I’m thinking of starting therapy soon. Being worried and hyper aware of your body daily is just torture.

Articles are popping up everyday about these cancers,  and I haven’t even looked up cancer in my search bar. This is the first time I’ve typed it out. I know there’s a term for this, when you start seeing the same car after you buy one. But this is crazy, it’s really making things worse for me.

253,2019-12-05T03:29:18+00:00,Gilsworth,"Hello, I'm okay and so are you - snap snap - it's all okay","Like many on here I have been utterly convinced that death was rapping on my door ready to whisk my into that gentle night and every time I go to answer it's just another version of myself standing dumbly at the other side of the door wearing a hood and cloak. 
I have had every symptom under the sun and yet despite what Dr. Google tells me I am still in near perfect health. What is the biggest and realest detriment to my health? Anxiety. It plagues my mind and has me pissing every 5 minutes in the night thinking I have diabetes or kidney failure (I'm actually just so dehydrated from fear that I gulp buckets of water every night). 
Hell, just a moment ago I had somehow convinced myself that I have skin cancer because my hand was itchy. Why was it itchy? Because every damn time I take a piss from the waterfall I consume I wash and scrub my hands. Now I am no longer itchy because I chilled out some and used logic to slay that fear. 
I have a fluttering on the left side of my body, has to be some wicked mediaeval disease that wants to make me its playground, right? No, it's just the tummy rumbles that only ever appear when I am anxious.
Wait, do I have more moles than before? Yeah, must be dying... any day now... just waiting for that cancer... y'know, just wake me up when it starts to get interesting. 
Ah, but this persistent uncomfortable leg feeling is deep vein thrombosis. But of course! I sit too much. So when will it shoot up and annihilate my brain? Probably fucking never actually. 
I am very much alive. Very much in good health, and besides a very overactive imagination and a love for horror, I am just another normal human being who occasionally finds themself short of breath - amongst millions of others - doing normal human things. 
What I have come to learn is that these symptoms aren't ones of imminent death but rather ones of life.
Feel your heart beating weirdly? Guess what! Your heart is beating, it changing its pace or pattern is just what it does. Stop judging it so hard, man. Is your arm numb? Well shit, it might just be a normal human arm - sorry for the prognosis (in case you were hoping that you were another species).
If you feel anything at all it is a symptom of life. 
If it's uncomfortable then perhaps you shouldn't drink 3 cups of coffee tomorrow aye? Or maybe your bedtime was basically yesterday. 
You don't need reassurance, you need the sort of logic that experience gives you. If you've survived 5 false signs already then the 6th one is very likely to be nothing.
""But the boy who cried wolf was right eventually!"" Yeah, but you're on wolf watch in the fuckin' city and you're not just crying ""wolf"" but also ""lion"" and ""'gator"" at the slightest flashes of yellow and green. It's just a traffic light, go back to bed, chill out. 
You haven't died since you began reading all of this have you? (Maybe a few braincells but that's just the Gilsworth charm).
So I'm here to remind you that you are okay, you're good, you're golden - and even if you weren't then the fact of the matter is that we live in an unprecedented time of medical wonder. 
You are here because you know you worry, not because you know you have cancer.

I’ve been so scared that Covid mixed with my “HIV”, “lung cancer”, “diabetes” etc would at least put me in the hospital. 
Then a month ago I woke up and drank some coffee that to my surprise tasted like water. Concerned and slightly amused I went through my refrigerator and starting trying to taste the most potent things I could find and my taste buds had absolutely no reaction. 
I start raising the alarm a bit by contacting people I’ve been around and reaching out to my mom. I got gaslighted by everyone. A familiar feeling for those of us who often “cry wolf” about health issues. But this time was different because I wasn’t even freaking out about it. I felt in good health besides not being able to taste or smell. Despite everyone telling me it was just allergies I scheduled a test. 
Two days later and still no taste buds my diagnosis is confirmed, I got Covid. This is the first time my health suspicions are correct so instead of feeling relief I don’t have an illness I’m oddly relieved that I was right. I felt vindicated that I was able to accurately assess myself for once and on top of that I didn’t panic! 
My doctor checked in with me every other day and they told me it was clear I had a really mild case. My taste came back after a week and I was released from quarantine after ten days. Everyone I had been around for the past two weeks got tested ( about 10 people) and no one else was infected. 
Reflecting on my experience with Covid I’ve realized my health anxiety has been greatly reduced. I got covid and didn’t end up in the hospital! Therefore it’s even more unlikely that I have an unknown autoimmune disease or cancer! Who really knows if there’s a correlation, but for now I’m doing so much better and it’s all thanks to covid!
Statistics can either be scary or helpful so I won’t list any here. I do want to remind all of you that severe cases are getting rarer and that the majority of those with covid have a mild infection. We will get through this, you’re healthier than you think! Lots of love!
Disclaimer: I don’t consider myself to be very healthy in my daily life. My BMI is overweight bordering on obese so I technically am at a higher risk. I am incredibly lucky to have not given it to any friends or family. I was not safe and had gone away on a weekend trip for my birthday, which is where I assume I got it. I am completely responsible for getting Covid.

I just want to thank you all for your kind words and reassurance whenever I posted on here. I’m saying this is my last post on here because I’m really trying to break away from all things health anxiety related so I figured I’d let it all out on here. Today I saw my doctor regarding that lymph node/lump on the right of my neck near my manidible but a little further that I posted about and she said honestly it feels normal and there’s no point in testing it or anything unless it were to get bigger. 
I had my father feel it and he claims i’ve had this thing since I was a kid and idk if he’s just saying that to ease my concerns but there’s that as well.
Bottom line is, I’ve convinced myself that I had Testicular Cancer, Meningitis, Colon Cancer, Skin Cancer for almost a year now and I just want to be through with it. I let myself really not appreciate life in the way that I used to for a whole year and I am sick of it. Today hopefully i’ll be making my change to beat this and carry on healthy. I just need the willpower and strength to do so. I’m tired of waking up afraid to look at my body, to move a certain way, to look at myself in the mirror in fear that i’m going to have a disease or something. I get so down I can’t enjoy those around me cause i’m afraid of being sick. It’s just not a great way to live and I want to be finished with this way of thinking.

We are a unique group of individuals.  I remember when I first came here 4 years ago and having this door open where it was like ""I'm not alone!"".
This is a long one, so get ready.
That being said,  we as mods need to do better at curating this sub for the health of the community and its users.  What does that mean exactly? Well, we are going to realign this sub and focus on what Health Anxiety is, which is a mental illness. The goal of coming to this subreddit should be getting proper mental help. This sub will no longer be a place for people to come and constantly seek assurance. Moving forward it will be focused on helping individuals who are getting treatment or seeking treatment for this mental illness.  We refuse to enable reassurance seeking. In the coming weeks we are going to setup a more rigorous Auto-Mod feature that will crack down on posts that go against our rules.
Speaking of rules, we will be updating them to be more clear on what is and isn't going to be removed going forward. Specifically the most drastic change will be revolving around what we will consider ""asking for a diagnosis"".  Moving forward, any posts listing symptoms, results, or having any questions about ""what this could be"" will be removed. For the love of god, we ARE NOT doctors, 99% of the people who visit, comment, or post ARE NOT doctors. If you are a doctor, please do us a favor, and don't try and offer diagnoses.  IF you truly think something is wrong, you need to see a doctor, don't ask random strangers on the internet if we think you have something. To help everyone understand I will provide some examples:
WHAT NOT TO SAY: 

""I have been having terrible chest pains for the last week. I'm a 22 M 189 pounds. I got my blood work done and there were some elevations regarding my WBC by 1.2 what does this mean?""
""I have a strange lump under my armpit its 2mm and slightly movable, its been there for a month and I have lost some weight, I'm positive I have x cancer.""
""I've been doing research regarding X and I have a, b, and c symptoms, does this mean I have x?""

WHAT YOU CAN SAY:

""I am struggling with heart related fears, its consuming my thoughts and it is getting difficult to focus on other things.""
""I'm convinced I have X cancer and I can't stop checking for symptoms, what I can I do to break this cycle?""
""I can't stop using google to look up random symptoms and freaking out about things, I could really use support.""
Or simply ""I'm struggling hard right now, I could use some help/support.""

Its pretty straight forward, don't talk about symptoms or signs, focus on how HA is affecting your life. You are more than welcome to share your fears, but we don't need to hear about your symptoms or your self diagnosis.  This is a support group for overcoming a diagnosed mental illness we can't diagnose you! If we notice a pattern, we will give you a timeout.
The Other Newer Rules:

Certain ""buzz illnesses"" will be automatically removed. AKA stop asking or freaking out about the Coronavirus.  We will NOT allow media-hyped illness to overrun or dominate the sub.  Please use the corresponding megathread.
Under NO circumstance will we allow any negative talks about doctors or medications. This isn't the place, and it only hurts the people coming here for support. If you don't believe your doctor that's a significant sign that you need medical intervention regarding your mental illness.
Do not solicit or give advice on medication dosages or stopping medications those will be removed. That is a question for a trained medical professional. 
No one, and I mean no one wants to watch your video on how you started meditating facing the sun, doing naked yoga, and running barefoot over legos to ""cure"" you anxiety.  We will remove any posts to YT channels and perma ban you.  This is a support group, not an advertising platform for you to push traffic to get ad money.
Try to be as vague as possible about NSFW fears, we don't want to hear about your junk, sex life, or masturbation habits. They will be removed, and repeat offenders will be banned.
This isn't new, but I will restate it because its important: ANY POSTS THREATENING, ALLUDING, OR SUGGESTING SUICIDE WILL BE REMOVED.  No one here is equipped to handle these conversations, there are plenty of resources where you can speak to trained individuals.  Please don't put the weight of that on the people coming here looking for support themselves.

This is the start of the framework of taking the sub back, and moving towards helping people get the right kind of help.  Feel free to message us, or drop a comment with your thoughts.  Also I would like to plug the discord https://discord.gg/pQ2dHnU.

I was feeling fine all day, just the typical sore arm. Then my body started getting tired after 8 hours. After 11 hours, I get the chills. I put on the heater, and a jacket. When I went to bed, I woke up 3 hours later with a fever and feeling like I got hit by a bus. I took some meds and went back to sleep. Today, I don’t have a fever, my body is just tired and my arm isn’t sore as much. I just have a headache. 
Yes, I was dreading the symptoms, but honestly, I rather have these temporary symptoms than having Covid. 
If you’re afraid of getting the vaccine, don’t. You can’t let your anxiety control your life, you control your life. 
Yes, I still have get health anxiety, like taking new meds, and getting injections, but I think to myself “These meds are a backup army to help your immune system fight the war”
Good luck everyone!
Update: it’s been almost 36 hours since I got my vaccine. All of my symptoms are going away. Just feel a little achy and tired. I should be fine by tonight
Update 2: received my vaccine on Saturday, all symptoms gone by Monday morning. Saturday to mid Sunday was when all the symptoms were at it’s peak. Don’t be afraid, the vaccine is worth it.

266,2019-07-22T23:42:46+00:00,ConnectWillingness4,HIV anxiety. I had all the symptoms.,"I've always been scared of HIV, its mainly the reason I don't hook up very often with other people. I had one of those scares a few years ago and I promised myself to never get in a position like that again. 
Well then 5 weeks ago I had this encounter with a guy where I was the receptive partner. We used condoms so I was not worried at all.
Then EXACTLY 4 weeks after, I get flu-like symptoms. I started to freak out. I knew acute HIV symptoms occurred 4-5 weeks after the posible infection so I said to myself how can this be a coincidence? I had swollen lymph nodes, fever, chills, night sweats, sore throat, fatigue, even a canker sore, etc. I had everything. I connected the dots and all fitted. I did have bleeding gums so I thought it was maybe that and got it through oral. 
Then it crossed my mind that he tricked me and used a non-latex condom. Or that maybe the condom had a small tear. I thought of all the possibilities imaginable. I even thought he was homophobic and liked to infect other people. My mind was so fucked up. I went to the doctor and she said I had the flu. I got really scared, even more when I read the printed diagnosis and it said ""Flu due to unknown virus"". I was so sure that virus was HIV and that I just had flu-like symptoms, specially because I didn't spread the flu to anyone in my house, and I had read that the flu-like symptoms you get from HIV are not contagious. I remember telling her that I wanted to get checked for HIV and the look on her face was, for me, that she had figured it out and that now my symptoms made sense and it was HIV. She then said that HIV people live normal lives and it's not a death sentence anymore, and my mind said ""she's saying that to make me feel better because she now thinks its 100% HIV but doesn't want to tell me"" 
So I recover from the flu but then my throat starts to hurt, a sharp pain in my left tonsil, swollen uvula, redness in the back of my throat, etc. My immune system was weak (due to HIV) so probably I catched something, I thought. My body was seroconverting and I had every cell fighting the virus so an opportunist illness took advantage and I got sick again, the day after recovering from the supposedly flu-like symptoms I had. It got to a point where I said to myself that I had to accept I was carrying the virus and deal with it (a fake bravery I summoned don't know from where). Started thinking who am I gonna tell and treatment options. I felt so different. I have HIV now. This is now my life.
Finally I got tested today at the 5th week mark and I took a big nap to wait for the result because I couldn't handle it anymore. Checked my email and it was a negative result. I felt so relieved. I had a 4th generation test done so its pretty much conclusive but I'm still taking it again at the 3 months mark just to make sure, even though I know the result is unlikely to change. I will update this and post my result when that time comes.
So please, don't freak out with HIV acute symptoms. Don't google symptoms. Just get tested. I think I looked up through every forum in the internet reading HIV stories and how they experienced exactly the symptoms I had and it only made it worse. The mind is so powerful and when we are in a vulnerable position everything you throw at it spreads like fire, feeding it with negative thoughts. The brain likes to look for ways to please its own way of thinking and make it look rational now matter how irrational they might be. So please avoid looking up symptoms, stories, etc. I was so certain I was carrying the virus because the coincidences were too much, and I still got a negative result. IM NEVER googling symptoms for anything again. It only makes you feel worse.
I've always been a little hypochondriac. When I was younger I thought about cancer all the time. As I grew up I was sure I had some kind of heart problem and started getting panic attacks because of it. I was still young and did not know those were panic attacks so I thought I was having heart attacks. Now my fear is HIV, but I'm not fueling my anxiety anymore by googling shit. I'm still a bit insecure because I'm waiting for the 3 months mark but I'm not going into a quest for searching the accuracy of tests at x-week or things like that for hours on end. All I know is that my result is unlikely to change, and I won't feed my fear and anxiety by scrolling through endless websites and fucking my mind up. 
I hope this helps ease the mind of anyone going through the same, and I encourage everyone to leave behind everything they might have read on the internet about HIV acute symptoms, or any symptoms of any illness, please! Take care of your mind and don't feed it with the crap that's on the internet, specially when you are so vulnerable! This was eye opening for me. Your brain will only look for a way to justify your irrational thinking and only you are responsible for giving your brain more information to back up those thinkings!",110,Create an account,https://old.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/cgkxtf/hiv_anxiety_i_had_all_the_symptoms/,,,,,1,957,15.61,3.43,92.67,6.05,17.09,5.96,1.99,3.66,2.3,0.1,1.99,1.46,0,0,0.42,6.48,2.93,0.84,0.42,0.21,0.1,1.36,3.34,0,0,0.73,0.31,0.84,0,0,0.84,0.94,0.1,0.1,0.73,0,0,10.24,7.84,4.6,0,0.52,0,1.99,0.31,0.1,0.21,0.31,1.78,0,0,0.21,6.58,8.25,4.28,1.15,12.96,5.43,3.45,0.1,0.31,1.99,1.67,0

Trust your doctor. Your health is their livelihood they have seen everything there is to see. If they say your fine - you. are. fine
Your not that lucky. Every time you think you have something “rare”, you don’t. Think about how many times you haven’t won a prize and how lucky your not. That is how unlikely it is that your sick.
If the symptom is smaller than a coin, it’s probably nothing. Across the body, small things generally mean nothing. 
Pain is a terrible indicator of how bad something is. Pulling out a pubic hair hurts like a b*itch but it’s harmless. 
It’s heartburn. Like seriously so many of the posts on here are so clearly heartburn or indigestion. If you feel pain anywhere in the chest or heart I can almost guarantee it’s to much ‘bad’ food. Sure check with your doc, but if your otherwise healthy it’s heartburn. 
the human body is very resident. In 1965 the average lifespan was 70. When our medical knowledge was basically nothing, when we didn’t have scanning tools or life saving drugs. When literally everyone smoked, the average lifespan was 70. Humans are impressive and out bodies are built to last.

I hope this helps - mainly I just want you all to remember that your okay. You will all be okay.

i need some of you guys who don’t trust doctors and are scared to understand how much a simple bloodwork test shows your overall health.
technology has come so far with our blood that bloodwork by itself shows many MANY possible things that could be going wrong in your body.
so if you convince yourself you’ve got a tumor, or your heart doesn’t work how it’s supposed to, or you have some other horrible ailment, and all your doctor did was take your blood then tell you that you’re fine? they weren’t lying to you.
they check for proteins, enzymes, deficiencies, ketones, even checking your white blood cell count to see if there’s ANY significant inflammation in your body. a full bloodwork test is VERY thorough. your blood does NOT lie about your physical health. doctors do not go to school for 8+ years for us to doubt them when they tell us that we’re healthy.
so if you’re scared for your health, and you think you need this test done or that test done, but you’ve had bloodwork done already and it came back clean? relax. stress does crazy things to the body, and you will be okay.",106,Create an account,https://old.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/kwz53w/clean_bloodwork_tests_are_a_godsend/,,,,,1,240,5.99,98.06,23.65,15.56,18.46,5,2.08,2.5,2.08,0.42,1.25,1.25,0,0,0,17.5,3.33,0,0,0,0.42,1.67,14.17,0,0,0,0.42,0.42,0,0,0.42,5,0.42,0,4.17,0,0.42,10,4.17,1.25,0.42,0,0,0,0,0,1.25,0.42,1.25,0.42,0.42,0,1.67,5.42,5.42,2.08,14.58,4.58,4.17,0.83,0,4.17,0.83,0

Recognize what is bothering you, and say out loud, “my anxiety is making me feel ” (fill in _ with what you’re feeling). It’s important to not push away your feelings and face them! 
Stop googling. This is an obvious one, but speaking from personal experience, it’s really hard to quit looking up symptoms when it’s on your mind 24/7. 99.99999% of the time, google. Is. Wrong. I have gone to the doctor for so many different symptoms, and every single time it was never what google scared me into believing. 
Get up and walk around. When we have anxiety, we increase adrenaline levels. Sitting around and letting our mind think crazy thoughts is only going to contribute to more adrenaline and fear. So, a great way to release that energy is to move around! Even if that means going outside for a few minutes! 
Meditate. Allow your body to relax for just a few minutes, and do some stretching. 
Exercise! Exercising is a GREAT way to release all that energy from your anxiety, AND contribute to an even healthier version of yourself! It’s a win win. Also, I have felt that sometimes I become very aware of my breathing when I workout which can make my anxiety worse, but you need to keep in mind that exercising is beneficial to any form of symptom. Working out is ONLY beneficial, and if you don’t feel comfortable doing a full exercise routine yet, pace yourself and take your time. There’s no rush!

----
My health anxiety is really a fear of death. 
One of the things I’ve always struggled with is acceptance. Accepting the inevitable. 
For months I was one hundred percent CONVINCED that I had multiple chronic illnesses despite all testing saying otherwise. 
I knew at a rational level that I was being illogical. But my subconscious was TERRIFIED. In the depths of my mind far underneath the surface, I believed that I was dying. I believed my body had failed me. I believed that I had lost control and that the outcome would be an irreversible swift and terrible death via cancer, disease, etc. 
These beliefs manifested real physical symptoms. 
My nervous system became confused - constantly firing off, leading to random full body twitching. My blood vessels expanded, leading to yellow and blue bruising and small pink dots covering my body. I broke out in rashes and my jaw popped from clenching my teeth through the night. 
I didn’t even realize I walked around with my shoulders up to my ears, always holding my breath, restricting my breathing and precious air flow to the rest of my organs which of course led to shortness of breath and chest/muscle pain.
One day when walking around in nature, I realized something - I looked all around me and truly saw the beauty of my environment. A breeze blew and my nostrils were full of the smell of freshly mowed summer grass and nearby flowers. 
I thought to myself “I am a part of this.” “This” being a world that is built of organic, natural, beautiful matter. All the things around me as well as myself would eventually break down in a never ending cycle of growth and decline. 
Growth and decline. Growth and decline. Growth and decline. 
I realized that there was no use in fighting it. The flowers do not fight their decline. They simply move into the next phase of existence. 
I realized that the sooner I can accept this, the happier I could be in life. 
By all means, get all the tests, explore sickness and illness and if there’s a real fight to be had, then by God, fight it. 
But if you are simply afraid of natural decline, I welcome you to join me in surrendering control of the things that we cannot change. 
I would like to add that my 'realization' was a turning point for me, but it only came after MONTHS of putting in the work of getting treated for my anxiety and panic disorder. 
As someone that has been diagnosed by a psychiatrist with obsessive compulsive tendencies (also GAD and Panic Disorder), I personally know how hard it is to just 'change your thought process' or 'turn off' your anxiety. 
I had to be put on high doses of anti anxiety medications and panic disorder medications to calm my central nervous system down before I could even begin to explore any sort of concept of surrender and acceptance or do anything else really. I am now weaning myself off all medications in favor of natural coping mechanisms. 
I also had to give things up (alcohol) and add things into my daily routines (exercise, yoga, journaling, meditation). It's freaking hard work. It requires intentionality and deep focus. 
But trust me when I say that with hard work, determination, and commitment, I think that it is possible for you to better manage your health anxiety. Please don't give up.

278,2021-05-30T04:30:48+00:00,Kouunno,Two important facts I've learned (that might help you if you have C anxiety),"Pain, by itself, doesn't mean anything.

Like, yes, you'll see pain listed as a symptom of a lot of cancers, but that's because it's a symptom of like, most things. Cancer typically causes a lot of other symptoms, and usually pain isn't the first one either. If you're like me and you have stomach pain or back pain and no other issues, the chances of cancer causing it are astronomical. You would be having other problems, especially if the pain has been ongoing for a while.

Anxiety and generic cancer symptoms have a really annoying amount of overlap.

Especially ""unexplained weight loss"" and ""loss of appetite"", which are like the most common cancer symptoms across most cancers. Anxiety, especially severe anxiety, can easily cause those exact problems. Case study: me. I could barely eat for two weeks and lost 10 pounds, because I was anxious about cancer, which obviously just made me more anxious. When I finally started to feel better my appetite came back and I've already gained back most of the weight. The pain that made me anxious to begin with is still present but I'm eating fine and generally feel much less ill.
I've certainly not cracked the secret to health anxiety yet; honestly I'm posting this because I'm spiraling a bit right now and I need to reassure myself. But hopefully my self-reassurances can help other people too.",105,Create an account,https://old.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/no3g46/two_important_facts_ive_learned_that_might_help/,,,,,1,246,13.85,3.76,65.56,1,17.57,9.76,2.44,7.32,6.91,0.41,6.5,3.25,0.41,0,0,5.69,2.85,0.81,0,0.41,0,0.41,2.85,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.41,0,0,0.41,0,0,12.6,10.98,7.72,0.81,0,0,0,1.22,0,0.41,0.41,0.41,0.41,0,0,4.47,4.88,6.91,1.63,19.92,5.69,5.69,0,0,4.88,3.66,0

It all started because of some weird, pulsating waves of numbness/tingling in my lower legs... It's so depressing knowing that I'll have the same panicky reaction whenever anything painful/irritating/slightly noticeable comes back. I've just been fortunate enough to be pain-free for a couple months because I'm young-ish (26). I can only imagine what's going to happen when I get older and have consistent pain that comes with the territory... :/
Has anyone else felt this way? Like you have your stuff under control, but then realize it's only because you've been luckily skating on the thin ice of being pain-free for a while?

I was doing so much better for two full weeks, had zero of my usual symptoms. Then I took a very small dose of benzo because my therapist suggested I take it to help fix my sleep schedule. Literally the second I swallowed the pill I had a severe panic attack. My worst symptom - air hunger - came back and I though I actually couldn't breathe at all. I was shaking and I felt paranoid that I would have an allergic reaction and kept checking my throat every ten minutes. It was hell. And it lasted at least an hour before the worst of the panic subsided. Even then I still felt very panicky for the rest of the night, and two days later I'm still having shortness of breath (this is the chronic symptom I had before).
Before this I was thinking about starting Zoloft but this made me realize just how severe my fear of medication is. I don't think I could handle an antidepressant, I don't know if I can even handle benzo again.
My anxiety is working in such a way that I literally can't take anxiety medication without it making me much, much worse.

288,2022-01-04T17:18:31+00:00,Kouunno,A reminder that statistics are tricky.,"This is for you if you've read at some point something like ""X risk factor makes you 20% more likely to get Y illness"". You've probably seen something like that and panicked because X risk factor is something you can't change, and now you're doomed to get Y illness because of it. What you need to remember is that numbers are tricky, and that even when the numbers look bad it means less than you think.
Let's do some examples. These are all made up so they won't spike anyone's anxiety.
Ex 1: ""Being female gives you a 20% higher chance of getting Exploding Bones Disease (EBD).""
This is probably the most common kind, you'll see a lot of 10-50% chance increases. 20% sounds pretty significant, right? Well, how many people in this example get EBD? Even if it was an extremely common illness- let's say 10% of the population gets it- 20% would only add 2% to that. How different does a 12% likelihood feel vs 10%? Barely different, right?
The difference is even lower with less common illnesses. Say an illness has a 1% chance of occurring: a 20% increase = a 1.2% chance. Practically no increase on an individual level.
Ex 2: ""Drinking one soda a week gives you a 100% increase in incidence of Popping Teeth Syndrome (PTS).""
Okay, a much higher number now. This also applies to ""twofold increase"" or even ""threefold increase"". 
Again, how common is PTS in this example? Assuming it's not extremely common, a twofold increase is not a lot. 1% -> 2%. 0.2% -> 0.4%. Basically barely an increase. Yes, if something is already very common a twofold increase is pretty significant; a boost from 20% to 40% is pretty major for example. But the vast, vast majority of illnesses (including the ones you're worried about, almost certainly) are not nearly that common. Hell, outside of the common cold I don't know that anything's so common as a 20% incidence.
So why are these stats important if they're such minor increases? Because they're applied to populations, not individuals. For example: let's go back to EBD (a very fake disease, if that wasn't clear). Let's say it has a 1% incidence rate and a 20% increased chance of occurring in women. Let's also look at the population of the US. The adult population is about 250 million. So for any one woman in the US their likelihood of getting EBD is 1.2%. Barely an increase at all. But over the population of the whole country (assuming a 50/50 split of men and women, I know that isn't exactly accurate), look:
1% of men have EBD: 1,250,000 cases
1.2% of women have EBD: 1,500,000 cases
That's 250,000 extra cases among women vs. men per year. That's very significant if you're a scientist and you're studying this, and definitely a thing for doctors and other professionals to consider. However, as an individual, this does not matter to you. For you, personally, the chance is 1.2%. Or, put another way, your chances of not having the illness are 98.8%. 
TL;DR: The stats are never as grim as they might seem. While risk factors may increase the possibility for an illness, for any individual person the risk of getting that disorder is almost always very low. Stats are there to show overall trends that are significant for scientific research. They are not there for you to give yourselves panic attacks.",103,Create an account,https://old.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/rvzib7/a_reminder_that_statistics_are_tricky/,,,,,1,578,40.53,62.62,22.81,2.19,13.14,3.63,0.35,3.11,2.6,0,1.21,0.87,0,0.17,0.17,9.69,1.04,0,0,0,0.17,0.69,7.96,0,0,1.04,0.52,0.69,0.69,0,0,1.21,0,0,1.04,0,0.17,3.63,2.94,2.25,0,0.35,0,0,0.35,0,0.17,0,1.21,0.35,0.17,0,2.08,1.38,9.17,0.69,29.76,7.96,5.19,1.04,0,4.15,11.42,0

I was an avid runner before this, but I don't think I'll be running anytime soon because my lungs hurt when I take really deep breathes and because I'm afraid I'll get myocarditis and have a heart attack and die. But I do have to remember that their might be a possibility of me being absolutely fine and not developing any of those things as well. It'll just take a while for me getting back to normal.

My stress and anxiety has gotten so bad that I was giving myself regular ectopic heartbeat, skipped heartbeats and PVCs. I’ve had every heart test known to man I’ve been to the emergency room More times than I can count hooked up to countless EKGs have had two sonograms of my heart lots of bloodwork and I’ve seen two different cardiologist. & guess what y’all ... I AM FINE!!! HEALTHY FINE & ALIVE . You would be absolutely amazed to know what stress and anxiety can do to your body. My stress has gotten so bad I wasn’t even having regular bowel movements, constant pit in the middle of my chest. As I sit here right now and write this my job is super clinched which it is all the time due to me unknowingly being stressed. Constantly monitoring my heart rhythm and being able to feel my strong pulse. But literally it is all because of anxiety you guys we are fine we are healthy we have been to the doctor countless times! Times where I am so distracted that I don’t notice my heartbeat I feel perfectly fine. We need to believe the doctors. I’ve spent so much time thinking that I was going to drop dead , But I actually wasn’t even living this year I was just going through the motions. I’ve decided that for the new year I am absolutely excepting that I am healthy and I am going to try with EVERY FIBER OF MY BEING TO RELAX & ACCEPT THAT I AM A HEALTHY 25 year old :) . I am literally doing nothing but stressing myself out making my hair fall out causing myself stomach and chest pain.

It’s our bodies way of communicating what’s going on on the inside. It’s not fatal or deadly. Sometimes nearly too much has will cause your stomachs to hurt, so we think appendicitis. A headache is almost always neck strain, eye strain, or dehydration. That sharp pain in your chest? It may be muscular more likely because your young. The body isn’t just organs and blood. It’s in an impossibly complex array of muscle fibers, nerve channels, and bones. Sometimes our musculoskeletal system aches and hurts and we don’t know why. We quickly attribute it to cancer or something horrible like a heart issue, whatever. I’ve been battling this for 3 years. Over the last 3 years I have thought I was dying several times per day, each day, for over 1000 days and let it consume my life. I was wrong every single time. Our bodies are very good at communicating with us, a cancerous mass, a internal bleed, or a heart attack will not let up or go away, they don’t come in intervals, the pain is unbearable and never goes away until you die.

302,2020-01-28T00:16:43+00:00,dougman505,One of the most important things to think about when you have health anxiety,"Hey again, I've been part of this community for the past few months now, and I've definitely had my ups and downs when it comes to health anxiety. For the past few months, it's been the fear of breast cancer for me (21 years old and male, go do the math on that one), despite numerous tests and reassurances from doctors.   
But, there was something I've always noticed when browsing this sub, and I'm pretty sure a lot of you have had the same experience. I'd scroll down the sub, looking for people with similar fears, and similar symptoms, hoping to find someone who can provide some form of reassurance. However, as I'd scroll, I'd see other people having their own issues, either related, or not related to my own.  
And I'd always have the same exact thought when looking at them: ""Oh, they can't POSSIBLY be sick, I'M the one with the illness!!"" Or ""Their anxiety is just causing their symptoms, but my symptoms are real!""  
And I'm pretty sure a lot of you had thought the same exact thing. We always think we're the exception, the .0000001%, the unlucky ones.   
But, I want you to ask yourself something: Why? Why do you think like that? Why are YOU the medical anomaly? I asked myself the same question, and genuinely, I couldn't come up with a decent answer.   
But that's what Health Anxiety does, it isolates you, it makes you feel as if you're alone, when you're not. Because, chances are, about a million people out there are also worried about the same symptoms you are, and how many of those people do you GENUINELY think are really sick?   
So, again, ask yourself: Why do you think you're the exception? Why are YOU somehow the unluckiest person in the world, that you have EVERY illness known to man?",106,Create an account,https://old.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/eux9xt/one_of_the_most_important_things_to_think_about/,,,,,1,323,7.45,56.69,88.61,3.91,19,4.64,1.24,3.41,3.72,0.31,2.79,2.17,0,0,0,14.24,3.1,0,0,0,0.31,1.86,10.84,0,0,0,0.62,0,0,0,0,0.93,0,0,0.93,0,0,4.64,4.33,1.55,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.62,0,0,0,0,5.26,4.33,7.74,0.31,24.15,3.1,9.6,1.86,0.93,5.57,3.1,0
303,2019-03-22T23:08:07+00:00,YouDontMeanLITERALLY,Unsubscribing today. Thanks for all of your support.,"This sub has helped me through a lot of health concerns, but today I'm finally in a place where I can deal with it on my own so I'm posting to hopefully help someone else.
I started off as a mess and eventually got a full heart/body checkup including an MRI and wore a heart monitor for 24-hours to check out my palpitations. After being told that everything is fine that was a big step. Getting a professional, comprehensive medical diagnosis to rule out what you're worried about goes a long way. After chest pains, numbness, tingling in my limbs, dizzy spells, being sent to the ER because urgent care thinks I might be having a stroke, and a ton of other shit, something outside my control changed: my stress level. I took on a different role at work that is much less stressful. I had no idea how big of an impact this was because I didn't consider myself ""stressed"" but several symptoms subsided with this change like everything digestive and the chest pain is less frequent. After I was told the chest pains are costochondritis (inflammation of the rib tissues, read: stress-induced) I saw a chiropractor for about 5 months who taught me some stretches and self-adjustments I could do with a back roller and now I've trained myself not to panic when I feel those chest pains. Just do the stretches and trust that I'm fine and sure enough, I am. Also, my doctor told me to cut caffeine and I didn't listen. I am a coffee junkie and cut back, but didn't cut it out entirely. Well recently I switched to decaf (I know, stick with me) and it's been life-changing. Yes, this is obvious. Yes, we all know caffeine raises your physiological arousal level. But many of us keep consuming caffeine not realizing just how much it actually contributes to the cycle. I'm a much happier person on decaf and I don't think I'll go back. I found out all of the shit I was dealing with can be caused by anxiety. So this whole time, it was the fear of a health problem that was causing health problems. Stress impacts us more than we realize!
So to recap, here are the things my dumb ass put off doing forever that really made a huge impact:
-Get a doctor's opinion. As in, a thorough one if possible instead of just a quick visit. They will run some tests and give you a professional take on it. When you get this - TRUST IT. If you have reason to believe the doctor missed something, get a second opinion but really you should trust the doctor.
-Manage your external stress. This doesn't mean quit your job, but if something is stressing you out (a situation at work, a significant other, family) take some real steps to get out of that situation! In my case it was a lateral transfer and a change in responsibilities but man did it lower my stress levels.
-Cut the caffeine and any other stimulants including recreational ones. If you struggle with anxiety, your brain is already pumping you full of stress hormones in a fight-or-flight response. You absolutely do not want to make it worse. Even a little can impact some people (like me, apparently).
-For the love of Reddit, never Google your symptoms.
The terrible thing about anxiety is once it has you, it's a downward spiral. But the inverse is true too. Once you are confident in your situation and know the quirks of your own body, you can come out of it quickly too.

304,2019-02-18T22:45:13+00:00,Alsoamdsufferer,Anyone else get really bad feelings of impending doom without being scared of a specific illness?,"My health anxiety is weird in that I don't really fear any 'specific' illness. Instead I worry about dying of an unknown/undiagnosed condition. I worry specifically that my consciousness is about to end, that I'm beginning the process of passing out and I'm never going to wake up.
I primarily get intense feelings of impending doom which leave me paralysed with fear, often unable to do anything but lie down in bed and close my eyes. In the past I used to go to the hospital a lot and beg the doctors not to let me die, but now I at least have the courage to just freak out at home.
The impending feelings of doom are so intense they leave me shaking and feeling cold. Sometimes while huddled in bed in the midst of a panic attack I even involuntarily shake and yell out things to myself like ""Please I don't want to die"". Like the fear of death is so strong I actually blurt things out reflexively without being able to control it.
This is happening to me basically every day now and leading me to spend increasing amounts of time just lying down at home. When I try and socialise I'm often distracted from the conversation by thoughts I'm about to die. I spend about 80% of my life fixated on these horrible thoughts aboht dying and about 10-20% of my life experiencing this intense feeling of doom.
I need help. I don't want to live like this any more.

Most of my anxiety regarding it is due to the world simply not knowing how to contain it. So, I decided to assume I will get it and look at it from a backwards standpoint statistically. We see worrisome mortality rates and our minds wander. I think they should be looked at differently. According to worldometers, for people aged 80+ years, the likelihood of making a full recovery is over 85%. If you’re a healthy 84 year old, chances are you’re fine. And I can’t imagine many of us here are that age. Not to mention, from that age group and down the death risk diminishes drastically.

all week i’ve been feeling a lot of anxiety leading up to getting the vaccine because i’m terrified of side effects. I don’t like anything making me feel sick at all so it sounded like a nightmare, however I knew I needed to get it done. 
I chose J+J because it is “one and done”. I am a 26 year old woman so I know the risk of blood clots. I can be rational enough to know that it’s very unlikely that’ll happen to me- which is weird bc my HA doesn’t make me rational at all lol. 
okay, so before the vaccine I drank sports drinks and water to stay hydrated! I got the vaccine at 3 p.m yesterday (friday). and was so proud of myself that I celebrated with sonic for lunch (i’m dieting so it was a big celebration LOL). then I went to my moms house after and spent the night so it would help calm the side effect anxieties. so here is my timeline so far:
the shot itself wasn’t bad at all. your typical vaccine. like I said, this was done at cvs at 3pm. I sat for 15 minutes after and then left for sonic
I ate sonic and was clearly not used to eating shitty food bc of my diet and it made my stomach hurt really bad (which freaked me out because of my fear of vomiting) but proceeded to my moms house anyway
around 5 pm, I noticed a headache I couldn’t shake. it wasn’t bad just prominent. the guy administering my vaccine told me to try to hold off taking pain reliever so I didn’t take anything 
between 7-9 I still had a stomach ache and some diarrhea (sorry TMI) and still had a headache. i’m trying to drink gatorade and water! 
I went to bed at 11:30 with no new side effects, just tired! 
my cat woke me up at 2am (about 11 hours after my shot) and I noticed I was a bit achey but nothing crazy. still no fever, etc. headache still prominent. crazy hungry since I haven’t eaten!
right now that’s where I am at!! I feel overall fine :) i’ll update when I get up for the day. 
I wanted to make this post because I’m so afraid of feeling bad and I contemplated this vaccine for so long. i’m not lying or exaggerating when I say that if I can get it, anyone can!
update: I woke up around 10am, still achy but it’s ok!! I ate and took some advil and am just watching that’s so raven now 😂
update again: 
I literally felt brand new within the blink of an eye! some point around 2:30 I felt like normal :) I did get a little tired and very very very very little bit of aches around 8:30 pm but I honestly popped an advil and feel completely normal. remember we all got this!

After weeks of having panic attacks every day, I feel, like, 75-85% normal and happy. All my physical symptoms are gone or better. Instead of googling I’ve been browsing this sub and using the CBT worksheet my therapist gave me to challenge the thoughts. I’ve been able to identify irrational fears much more easily. 
I’m shocked at how much better I feel. I knew it would help, but I thought I’d still feel significantly anxious. Nope. The intrusive thoughts are still there, but I’m able to live life now without an excessive amount of self-soothing and compulsions. Next I’m going to tackle the body checking and reassurance seeking. I feel extremely positive and proud about how I’ve been able to overcome this hurdle!
I don’t ever want to google symptoms again- it has literally NEVER helped me identify an illness or injury. It just made my mental health go to shit.

My anxiety was always about my heart palpitations, is it ok, am I dying? To the point where I would over-analyse every.single.thing I felt. Every twitch, every weird sensation, every pain, every little thing that my body did basically. I went to counselling for it and there I learned a new way to look at it and I wanted to share it and maybe it will help someone else as well!
​
Imagine a machine that scans your body. It could be like a light scanner inside of you that just scans your whole body all the time. People with health anxiety, people like me, in stressful situations, turn this scanner ON, usually because their life feels so overwhelming that they just need something to control and they feel like if they can at least control their own body and make sure its always at 100% things will get better; That's how I felt at least.
Now this scanner, once its ON it starts scanning. All. the. time. It scans from head to toe. It scans while you eat, while you drive, while you walk and it scans in the back of your mind; And then it happens:
​
You're walking down the street and you get a palpitation. You move your eyes too quickly and you feel dizzy for a moment. Your neck feels tight out of nowhere. A sharp sudden pain comes and goes in a moment out of nowhere. You name it - something small, something that passes in a second or two, something that this scanner is looking for;
​
And oh my god, does it send an alarm! Of course it does! The 'scanner' is literally waiting for something even remotely out of the ordinary, the tiniest of things to happen and it sends an alarm to the whole body. Suddenly you're in panic. What was that palpitation? Am I dying? Why am I dizzy, am I gonna faint? Etc. The panic passes and so does the symptom that ""caused it"" and now you're absolutely afraid of getting the same symptom again because you connect it to panic. And if you're like me - you connect it to the thing you were doing when it happened. In my case palpitations happened after I've eaten and it nearly created an eating disorder because I refused to eat anything more than a sandwich for months! I was afraid of eating because my brain was connecting the panic with food! I was afraid of food! 
​
So moving on, panic is done, you're calm. But the scanner... The scanner has done a good job. In your brain, the scanner has done a fantastic job at alarming you that something happened! So it keeps going, in the background of your mind, looking, waiting for something even remotely out of the ordinary to happen... and sometimes, if a whole day passes and this scanner is going on in the background, you'll feel tense AF, almost like you've waited a whole day for something bad to happen to you. And that feeling alone can trigger symptoms so hey, more work for that damn scanner! 
​
Now, every person has a scanner. However, in people with health anxiety that scanner is suuupeeer sensitive. An ordinary person's scanner would send an alarm when there's something genuinely wrong with you, something you need checked asap, but it wont send alarms for the day to day little things like heart skipping a single bit, small pain in your chest etc etc; 
​
So my way of dealing with it was once I realised that this was all that it was - I had a hyper sensitive health anxiety scanner in me haha! And its turned on most of the time, because of my health anxiety. So next time I get a weird sensation and my first thought is ""Shit im dying!"" I just follow it with ""nah, girl, thats the scanner's alarm"". And just recognising it as what it is - just a false alarm - helps calm me down and not go into full panic mode over something small. And remember, if it truly IS dangerous to you, the alarm will NOT STOP for hours, sometimes DAYS! And it will be more like ""Bring your attention to this symptom, its been happening in a while, it could mean something, you should  check it out"" and not ""OH MY GOD, THIS IS IT, IM DYING, THIS IS THE END, MY HEART IS FAILING, I CAN'T BREATHE""; Learn to recognise the difference in your own body.
​
So yeah, that's it! It helped me cope and I hope it helps you as well :) Remember, a hyper sensitive scanner will slowly turn into sensitive scanner and at the end you'll be just like everyone around you with no health anxiety. Its just until then, remember that you'll be fine and your body can indeed send false alarms because you're fixated on your health so much, it thinks its necessary to let you know about ANYTHING and EVERYTHING that's happening inside of you. 
Your heart is just having a hiccup and like every other muscle in your body, sometimes it twitches for no reason! Your head is just a bit dizzy, but think of all the times that you've been so happy or so excited about something that you also felt dizzy and you were still completely fine! You got this!
You'll be okay! Keep going! <3

324,2019-10-10T21:58:35+00:00,healthanxiety3252,"I beat health anxiety with this information, maybe you can too","For the past couple years my health anxiety was terrible. I would constantly think about my heart and other random shit about my body wondering if I was gonna die. It affected me everyday and there were many times when I was out doing something I had to physically leave because I was so anxious about my health.
Since about a month ago my health anxiety is nonexistent. I beat it, and it feels amazing to have my life back.
I recently found this sub and I empathize so much with the people here because I experienced the same things, I know how much it sucks. Hopefully this posts helps some people.
Preface: I'm getting a lot of this information out of Napoleon Hill's Think and Grow Rich. He talks about what he calls ""The Fear of Ill Health"" and his knowledge of the subject cured all my anxiety.
I'm gonna summarize what's said in the book:
The Mind
As I'm sure most of you know Health Anxiety is all created in the mind. This means that the mind is the only thing that can cure health anxiety. Also understand your mind is extremely powerful and completely connected to your body in ways we can't explain. Your health anxiety has nothing to do with your body, and everything to do with your mind.
Your mind and thoughts can affect your body in almost any way you let it. This is why health anxiety causes panic attacks and can even make you feel symptoms of the condition you're anxious about. Luckily we can control our mind and thoughts, therefore we can control and eliminate health anxiety.
The Fear of Ill Health
The Fear of Ill Health is traced to physical and social heredity. It's closely tied to the Fear of Death (which I'll touch on) because it leads us into places we don't know but imagine to be terrible.
In main, we Fear Ill Health due to the terrible pictures that have been put into our minds if death should overtake us. This is the root cause of your health anxiety.
Hypochondria is the habit of thinking about an illness, concentrating the mind upon the disease, and expecting its appearance until a nervous condition appears. This is what your health anxiety is. 
It's all created in your thoughts and mind! The mind is very powerful, it either builds or destroys us. Do not let your thoughts destroy you in the form of health anxiety.
The Fear of Death
Fearing death is pointless. Death is inevitable for everyone. You must accept death as a necessity and pass it out your mind. It must be necessary or it would not come at all. And if it is necessary, which it is, perhaps it is not as bad as you may think.
The entire world is made of two things, MATTER and ENERGY. From elementary school we learn that neither matter nor energy (the only two realities known) can ever be created or destroyed. Both matter and energy can be transformed, but never destroyed.
Life, if anything, is energy. If neither matter nor energy can be destroyed, then life can never truly be destroyed. Life, like many other forms of energy may passed through phases of transition and change, but never truly destroyed. Death is a mere transition.
Even if death is not a mere change, at its worst it will be a long and peaceful sleep, and sleep is nothing to be feared. Thus, we can wipe out the fear of death forever.
How To Get Over Your Worry
Relieve yourself of the fear of death by accepting that death is an inescapable event. Accepting this is a big step to beating health anxiety.
Eliminate the fear of ill health by ignoring your symptoms. Whenever you think you have a symptom just think to yourself ""I ignore my symptoms."" No matter what it is, think ""I ignore my symptoms.""
​
Understanding the above information and thinking ""I ignore my symptoms"" whenever something comes up has given me my life back.

325,2019-01-08T15:40:38+00:00,HariSeldonsFuture,Beginning a week of no “Googling” today! Anyone want to join?,"Title pretty much sums it up.
After reading some inspirational posts on here from people who conquered their battles with HA, I noticed one of the biggest things they said helped was to stop googling symptoms. So, I’m starting small. One week of no googling.
I’ve already had the urge about 5 times since I woke up 3 hours ago, lol, but I’m fighting through it. I will be updating this post everyday to say whether I succeeded or not for that given day to keep myself honest. 
I would absolutely LOVE if people on this sub would join me in this “challenge”. If you feel comfortable joining and commenting below that you are doing so, that would be amazing! I think having a sense of community and camaraderie is extremely important.
I hope this post isn’t breaking any rules! If so, I apologize and will edit accordingly.
TUESDAY 1/8 UPDATE: Well, I made it the whole day! It was a STRUGGLE. I had the urge about 10+ times today, but I resisted. In part thanks to you all. I never expected this many people would join this with me, and I am so excited and grateful! We’ve got this!
Also, due to multiple great suggestions, I plan to create another post at the end of the week for an open discussion on how it went for everyone! Feel free to update on this one as well during the week if it helps you. I know updating this every day will help me. 
Congratulations everyone, day one complete!
WEDNESDAY 1/9 UPDATE: Made it another day. Today was...hard. But, I fought through it. Focused on work, got more done than I have in a couple weeks, and went out for a relaxing dinner and drinks with my husband. Today was hard, I REALLY almost caved earlier. But I didn’t, and again I think I owe a good amount of that to all who joined me in this. It feels amazing to be a part of a “team” to fight this bullshit. I got some of my time back today.
THURSDAY 1/10 UPDATE: Made it another day!! Today was easier than yesterday. Focused a lot on work, then made a nice dinner when I got home. I had some physical symptoms/sensations, but I was able to ignore them long enough for them to move on. Today was a good day.
FRIDAY 1/11 UPDATE: Sorry for the late update! Went out to the bar until the wee hours last night, lol. Yesterday was not as good as Friday. I made it the whole day, but I had to reallllyyy talk myself down in the late afternoon with a weird symptom I’ve been having. I just kept saying “I know this is weird, but you are not in immediate danger, and you are in no pain. Just move on, enjoy the rest of your night, and if this persists for weeks you can revisit it then”. And let me tell ya, it fucking worked! I totally forgot about it and had an amazing night. Thank you all for giving me strength this week. If I didn’t make this post, I guarantee I would have caved already. 
SATURDAY 1/12 UPDATE: Still going strong! “Strong” may be a bit of an over exaggeration lol, but I am going. Like I said in the last update, my anxiety about my health is still very much there, just instead of ruminating on it for hours through google it comes in fleeting spurts that are easy to move on from. I still of course think I’m dying though, lol. 
SUNDAY-MONDAY UPDATE: Sorry guys, I forgot to update these two days. Which is actually kind of a good thing, because I wasn’t thinking about my health to the point of forgetting to even do this!

326,2022-01-07T20:36:53+00:00,Huge_Cry1380,"For anyone freaking out about colon cancer, here are some foods that can cause the dreaded black specks in bowel movements","One of the typically recognized symptoms of colon cancer is ""black specks in stool"" because that's usually an indication of a bleed somewhere in the digestive tract, which isn't a good thing whether it's caused by cancer or something else.
BUT there are lots of foods that can come out the other end of you that mimic this symptom. Some stuff will not digest all nice and neat and will exit your body having been exposed to digestion, but not necessarily getting fully digested, if that makes sense. 
I learned from a gastroenterologist that the process of digestion is what gives stool its color because normally it's more yellow due to bile, I think (sorry TMI), so it makes sense that undigested food exposed to the same process will darken in color too.
These foods include the following:

Fruits with itty bitty seeds (bananas, strawberries, raspberries, figs)
Fruits with dark skins (blueberries, blackberries, cherries, plums)
Flaky herbs (like parsley)
Nuts with skins still on them (peanuts, almonds, pecans). Note: Skins on nuts are considered an insoluble fiber, which means they are not digestible, which is why they might show up in a bowel movement. Nuts themselves are a soluble fiber. I just learned this today.
Beans with skins (kidney beans, black beans, red beans - I think these all contain insoluble fiber too)


Also, since black stools are another commonly reported symptom of colon cancer, here are some things you might consume that can bring on dark bowel movements too:

Pepto-Bismal, Maalox or Kaopectate (the active ingredient in these is bismuth subsalicylate, which can cause darkening of stools)
Too much dietary fiber (it's hard to even get enough fiber, let alone too much, so this one isn't as common)
Iron supplements or foods high in iron (which include many of the food items on either of these lists)
Food dyes/coloring (especially black, green or blue)
Red foods (tomatoes, red meat, red wine)
Black licorice or anything with activated charcoal in it
Naturally dark-colored foods (spinach, broccoli, beets,)


A couple other things to keep in mind: just about every source I saw said that things you've eaten are the cause of a vast majority of instances of black specks in stool and/or discolored stool - like at least 90%. So if you just pooped and it looked like it was full of pepper, consider what you've eaten within the last 48 hours and if it's on this list. Odds are if you don't consume that food again for a couple days, these symptoms will clear up.
Also, remember that stools with blood in them smell FOUL. Anyone who has ever smelled an intestinal bleed will know it is a much different and much worse smell from a normal BM. 
Obviously if you have these symptoms in conjunction with other strange new digestive issues that last 2-3 weeks without relief, it would likely warrant a doctor visit to rule out actual health issues. But if they go away with some temporary dietary changes, it's nothing to lose sleep over.",97,Create an account,https://old.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/ryh8ud/for_anyone_freaking_out_about_colon_cancer_here/,,,,,1,528,46.23,18.97,51.82,9.34,35.2,3.41,1.14,2.27,0.76,0.57,0.19,0.19,0,0,0,4.92,1.52,0.19,0,0,0.19,0.19,3.22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.57,0,0,0.57,0,0,11.55,2.84,1.14,0.38,0,0.19,0,6.25,0,0,0,0.38,0,0.57,0,3.03,2.84,6.06,1.33,18.75,2.84,6.63,0,0,2.08,7.2,0

This awareness doesn’t always mean pain but it usually feels like a strange numbness or awareness of a certain area of my body, which, no matter what I do to distract myself is almost always there. For example, recently I have been very worried about appendicitis so I am now constantly checking my stomach area for sensations and can now constantly feel a strange feeling in my stomach without even consciously trying. It’s like a kind of heaviness or a numbness rather than a pain- I’ve had this in so many areas of my body now it’s unbelievable, it drives me crazy because I can’t get away from it!

Even doctors have to go to doctors because self diagnosis is incredibly unreliable
The times that people have died from un-diagnosed ""silent"" conditions is far, far, far less than the amount of times that those conditions were present enough to cause concern in the patient, and get it fixed or treated. Our bodies are incredible alarm systems.
The symptoms of dehydration and lack of food are very very very real, and are often very similar to a lot of the scarier symptoms of more serious things. Think about it - even if you're a little hungry or dehydrated, your body is going to want you to know, it's going to cause non-dangerous symptoms. It really, really all could be just that - especially with how common dehydration is in the modern human.
EVERYTHING is a ""risk factor"". No, I promise I'm not saying this in a scary way. I'm saying that calling small things ""risk factors"" is sort of part of the fear-mongering that the internet does when it comes to health stuff. The term gets thrown around so easily about such small, normal things that it's basically not worth considering most of the time.
If you're anything like me then you probably live a very sedentary life - just remember that when you are sitting around doing nothing, your mind has all that free space to fill with health anxiety (and cause fake symptoms)
You can reliably assume that you are taking your symptoms too seriously and scaring yourself too much on a normal basis if you have gone to the length to be subscribed to this sub-reddit and be reading this post right now.
Everyone has weird symptoms. Everyone. All the time. Anything you can think of. My dad lived with chest pain for years and years when he was in his 20s, and he's now 61 and entirely healthy.
The average lifespan is the average for a reason. If you are under that age, especially if you are very young, the odds are intrinsically in your favor. Remember Occam's razor.

​
​
The title says it all.  I've been struggling with hypochondria and GAD for years but have had a particularly bad couple months recently.  Like so many of you, my anxiety produces so many random and unusual symptoms.  And every time I feel something new or unusual, I'm left compulsively reading every medical publication on what it could potentially mean and then relentlessly calling all my friends who are in the medical field, seeking reassurance that I am not on death's doorstep.
​
​
But then I stumbled upon this community
​
​
Reading all of your posts has truly helped me start challenging my oh-so-corrupted thought process.  You've helped me acknowledge just how complex a monster anxiety is and how many symptoms with supposedly nothing but ominous causes can indeed be attributed to anxiety. 
​
​
But the most important posts in this entire subreddit are the ones talking about reassurance, and how it is comparable to a drug.  Nothing could be a more accurate description of how addicted and dependent I've become on hearing the words: ""Everything seems fine.""  It seems to be a common theme among the success stories in this community that breaking ties with google and incessant doctor's appointments are the first steps to recovery.  Well, I'm happy to say that today I took that first step.  When I woke up this morning, I promised myself that every time I felt a pain or something unpleasant, and that massive urge to open up webMD started to come on, I was going to turn off my phone and walk away from it.  It was not easy, AT ALL.  Every minute that went by that I didn't do research, I felt like doom was closing in on me.  For hours the anxiety worsened until I was on the verge of having full blown panic attacks.....
​
But  then..... things started slowing down.  I realized my original symptoms that were triggering me had subsided....and in time, my fight or flight response had mostly stood down.  As I'm typing this, I still am very much on edge and am still feeling that crippling impulse, and I know I still have a long road ahead of me, but this was a big victory for me.  A big first step.

Ask to be put in a private vaccination pod. Here you will placed either on a chair or bed and will have a member of staff with you at all times. They will support you in any way possible and do everything to make you comfortable. They are there to help. 
Don’t worry if you panic or cry, we’ve seen it all! Take as long as you need. No other service users will be able to see you.

Evidence I am a hypochondriac and can’t trust my own diagnosis:
Thought I had HIV and testicular torsion in elementary school, both causing me great distress and was 10/10 convinced of both 
11th grade thought I had multiple melanomas (Face,Finger,Hand) because I was getting new benign moles, I was under the assumption that “birthmarks” only are at birth and any thing you get as you age is cancer. I scream cried every day, joined my first depression group , had a point I wasn’t eating, all because I was terrified I was gonna get my fingers and face amputated to get rid of the cancer and was having thoughts on how I’d have to finish the school year at home because of the huge scar on my face. I even got my phone taken away and parents called because of excessive use in class (melanoma researching)
These are all the illnesses I’ve “had” in the past 6 months:
Syphilis, Colorectal Cancer, Pancreatic Cancer, Parasitic Infection, Throat Cancer, Leukemia, Kidney Failure because of decreased urine output, Pictured me and my siblings getting transplanted to donate me liver, all because my bilirubin was elevated by 0.5 having a panic attack at the urgent care , Mast cell activation syndrome, Ruptured/dislocated esophagus from a sneeze, Spinal cancer causing constipation, erectile dysfunction etc.
The fact that I DONT have these illnesses and had SUCH SEVERE OBSESSION AND PANIC, means I CANT trust my own diagnosis. I WAS WRONG EVERY SINGLE TIME. 
Look at your history: first you think the skin lesions are from syphilis, well one 1 month of panic, days on end of research, calling planned parenthood hotlines , and a girl hating me for saying she had syphilis and was lying to me, I let it go. 
BUT NEXT, the same skin lesions must be caused by parasites , the same thing 1 month of panic and lab work and reading statistics, I let it go
BUT NOW, THE SAME SKIN LESIONS MUST BE MAST CELL ACTIVATION SYNDROME. When do I get a break?!!
Understand that you used the same symptoms/skin lesions to diagnose yourself with 3 different illness, it makes absolutely no sense and normal people don’t do this.

343,2020-02-22T20:04:06+00:00,mvmorris10,26 y/o male here. MRI came back normal! (Fear of MS),"Hello All! This post is long over due and a long one but the sun is shining out today, it is a beautiful day, and I feel like there’s not enough of these kind of posts on this subreddit so I thought I would like to share my story and maybe inspire and motivate others. Health anxiety has knocked me down more times then I can count (numerous panic attacks, fear of heart attacks, fear of ALS, fear of MS, fear of cancer) and I am so thankful for this group as I am not alone and I will continue to fight this type of anxiety day in and day out and I believe you guys can be able to fight it too as we are tougher and stronger then health anxiety. I can go ahead and tell my whole story from when all this first started (at 20 years old probably) but I will only tell my story from this past year:
Ever since July of 2019 I have been on edge as I believed I either had a brain tumour or MS. (My grandpa had MS so I was worrying that I might have gotten it) my symptoms started as: 
-Migraine with Aura  each episode lasting 30 mins and happening 5 times in the span of a week and a half (July-august) and this symptom hasn’t happened since but was still worrisome at the time!) 
-Bugs crawling on skin sensation (July-present)
-Headaches (July, still get them from time to time)
- right arm numbness (July-October on and off)
- right leg numbness (September-Novemberish)
-right pinky finger getting a cold sensation (October-present on and off) 
- sexual problems (this doesn’t happen all the time, but has been a problem every once in a while for past 3 years.. I have chalked it up to just being a nervous nelly and anxiety/stress)
-frequent urination (have always kind of been one to go to the washroom quite a bit... I also drink lots of water though) 
-brain fog (July-present on and off)
-body wide twitching (December 2018-present) 
- finger tremors (only really happens after a night of drinking)
- left leg tremors (probably just normal) 
-double vision (august-present, I have been told I have astigmatism though) 
-ghosting ( most likely due to astigmatism)
-seeing white/silver dots (this probably is the scariest now that I think about it cuz I dunno why I get them in my vision from time to time only last about half a second)
-cob webs In vision (probably just from aging who knows)
-left eye pain (July-November on and off, usually after lifting heavy weight in gym but I thought for months this was optic Neuritis, a prevalent Symptom of MS)
-Scotomas in vision when looking at the sky (august-present, about the same time as the migraines started)
-Dizzyness(august-December on and off)
-The list goes on but you get the picture. 
The above are majority of symptoms that fit the MS criteria. 
To say the least, this past year has been a living hell for me and has turned a lot of good days into brutally awful days. I thought there was going to be no hope for me on numerous occasions, I thought the possibility of MS was going to be a real reality for me. That I would have to give up the career I was pursuing which requires me to be healthy and do something else with my life. The possibility of what will my significant other think, what if my quality of life is effected. Etc etc. So many of these thoughts inside my head consumed me day in and day out. After the migraine symptoms and losing my vision temporarily and having a numb right arm after I decided to take action:
-Saw family doctor about issues late august
-Saw family doctor two weeks later as symptoms weren’t getting better. Family doctor going to refer me to a neurologist
-Late October get in to see neurologist. Neurologist refers me for MRI
-Jan 13 MRI appointment 
-Jan 25 results are back but have to wait until feb 13 to see neurologist (I think this time period was the worst anxiety wise)
-Feb 13 neurologist appointment.
FEB 13 The day has finally arrived. This is the day that is going to change my life forever. The day I receive my diagnosis of MS. I thought all was over. I sit down in my neurologists office, he starts talking as if he’s going to give me some bad news, and then he says “it appears there was no indication of demyelination diseases in your MRI scan (demyelination disease is MS) and it came back normal” I was so relieved I started crying in tears of joy as soon as I left the neurologists. I felt like I have just been rejuvenated, like I have been given a second chance. I felt so much weight slip off both of my shoulders and I immediately felt like the sky is still the limit for myself going forward. 
It is still surreal to this day and I am so thankful. Without a doubt I know I will still be battling this terrible hypochondriasm going forward as I know for a fact that it is not that easy to just get over. I will be seeking therapy in the near future and doing everything I can to be the best version of myself day in and day out. I will keep fighting and I believe you guys will keep fighting as well and I am here for you. I just wanted to tell my story to maybe give hope to others and to show that many of my symptoms that I had were ALL caused by Anxiety and Stress and that the brain is a very powerful organ that is capable of causing symptoms like that. 
I made a post earlier leading up to the neurologist appointment and there were a few of you that wanted to know how it went so hopefully you come across this post. And Thank you to everyone who took the time to read this. It was a long one.

For almost 12 years my mind has been telling me that I would not live through which ever year it was. I was convinced that I’d be dead by December. But guess what? Every. Single. Year. I saw winter. 
No matter how dizzy or how itchy or how weak I felt through all those years I still managed to make it to the end of the year. Managed to spend time with my family. Pushing through the never ending symptoms to try to enjoy at least an hour of family time. 
I know it’s hard to do but I urge you, this year, try to sit down and think of all the times you were convinced that it was your time. That it was finally here, your final days on Earth. And then think about how many times that was true. None, right? Please rationalize with that. I know i’m going to try my hardest to do so.

I have suffered from major health anxiety for about the last 2 years now on and off. It came completely out of the blue in my early twenties.  I would constantly slip in and out of major panic for days, weeks, and even months on end, while convincing myself that I had many forms of C*****. I do not know why I didn't think to find a subreddit for health anxiety until recently. (I usually just went on the diagnosing subreddits which made it worse).  After relapsing into panic attacks again over the last couple of days, I decided to go on Reddit to distract myself. After finding this community, I have felt so much better about my anxiety and knowing that there is a community of 42,000 people all willing to help each other beat their anxiety is so comforting to me. I read many of the posts and the reassurance and support from total strangers is another example of why the internet can be an amazing place. (When you are not Googling symptoms)

However I had an anxiety attack leading up to and after I got it today. I was running late to my appointment, had my 2 year old with me, and was anxious about the whole thing. They made me sit for 15 mins after I got it and I was a ball of anxiety. My heart was pounding & I had a few palpitations, my muscles were so tense I felt like I could barely walk (like my legs were going to give out), and I felt like I couldn’t breathe with my mask on. I started hyperventilating until I got outside and took my mask off and calmed down. Now I am totally fine, just so exhausted from that. 
I guess just venting and looking for some support. Hopefully at the next one I can get through it without an anxiety attack 😔

355,2020-12-08T16:31:00+00:00,as2565,We spend so much time thinking about the rare cases...,"We spend so much time thinking about rare diseases and disorders. A lot of us think ""Well, I have always been really healthy, but what if I'm actually not?"" Or we think ""I mostly take pretty good care of my health, but how much does that even matter?"" Our uncertainty-intolerant minds always go straight to the 1 in a million scenario, because that's what feeds into our fear, and we have learned to tend to our fear. Thinking ""Of course there's a one in a million chance I can have this rare blood disorder, but the odds of that are so much lower than any other thing that ever could have happened to me and didn't, so I'm not actually worried"" does not feed into our fear. It doesn't ""protect"" us in the way that we think we need protecting. 
When you get yourself worked up over the What ifs, think about all of the countless people before you who gave WAY less to their health-related fears than you do, and they still lived for a lot longer than you think you're going to live. Think about all those people who spent their whole lives thinking about what was actually happening rather than worrying about what might happen. Think about all of those people who really never did anything productive towards their health or did plenty of things that were bad for them. Think of all the people who lived in a time before modern medicine and before we really knew what was good or bad for us. Picasso lived until he was 91. Thomas Jefferson died at 83. Rosa Parks was 92. Eleanor of Aquitaine, who was alive in the MIDDLE AGES, died when she was 82. I know we tend to focus on those who died young, and those who die from crazy causes, but once in a while, focus on how amazing our ability to live long lives are and how amazing modern medicine is. We are strong and we are resilient. I'm guessing you have access to better health care than Eleanor of Aquitaine did. 
I'm sure your HA has argued this thought exercise every step of the way but just try to challenge it sometimes. What if you do live a long, healthy, happy life? What if you have minimal health problems before you die in your old age? What if you have SUCH a better chance than all those before you who died in their 80s or 90s after ignoring every lump, bump, and pain their whole lives?

Case in point, me right now- I started a few weeks ago with this feeling like I needed to pee all the time. Saw my doctor, he did a couple tests, nothing. This had happened a few months ago, same result. He said it was likely just a stress reaction or irritation from the balanitis I was diagnosed with a couple weeks prior, and there was nothing to be concerned about. It mostly went away for a week or so.   
I had my annual physical 3 weeks ago and my doctor did a full workup- all the blood tests, urine tests, STD panel, the whole shebang. Nothing comes up aside from some elevated cholesterol, not a new concern. He does a physical examination as well and tells me ""you're a healthy person."" Hearing that helped until it didn't.  
Fast forward a week- this weird urinary frequency is back, along with lower back and hip tightness and tenderness in the whole area. This includes the bladder, which freaks me out. I also get a recurring case of balanitis, doctor gives me a cream, it's clearing up. But then I had the thought ""What if this is a kidney infection or something?"" BAM, my mid back starts acting up. This ignores the fact that my reflux is back, likely because of stress and drinking coffee again (which I've stopped) and that I have no fever, fatigue, or any other signs of illness.   
I hate this. Everything I've just described is something I've dealt with before and ended up being nothing remotely serious. Lower back, pelvic, and hip discomfort? Posture is bad and it's pulling my hips in a direction they shouldn't go. Mid back pain, reflux, and gas? I used to be on Nexium for this and when I slouch, that's right where I end up rounding my back. Urinary frequency? Went away quickly without any fuss. But now it's happening all at once and my mind is racing and I hate all of it. The worst part is that none of it is even all that bad and the pains seem to come and go. I'm living pretty normally and when I'm busy or my mind is occupied, I don't even notice a lot of this. But here I am, afraid I have a kidney or bladder problem when I have multiple explanations on why that isn't true.   
I apologize for that leading nowhere, but I just needed to rant.

It helps me remember how powerful the mind is. One day, my co-worker gave me some Nandos chicken he brought for lunch. He mentioned something about, ""It was in the microwave over night though so I'm not sure if you want it."" I didn't think much of it. I ate the chicken. 
I woke up in the middle of the night. I felt a bit nauseaous, so I went to the washroom. I suddenly remembered what my co-worker said. Then it occured to me, oh my god I got food poisoning from the chicken left out over night. I frantically googled about e.coli.  Instantly, I started hurling.
My vision started to go black. I passed out. I ran outside into the fresh air and I almost lost consciousness. I was incredibly nauseous, dry heaving. I almost dialed 911, shaking, barely upright, seeing blackness close to passing out.
I quickly came to and phoned my co-worker. He told me he ate the same chicken and he was fine. He told me it was only out of the fridge for a couple hours. Instantly, my vision came back and I stopped shaking. My nausea disappated. It was all in my head. I was fine. 
Somehow my brain had taken over, assuming I was sick, and started producing the symptoms. In the days to come, I was fine. I didn't get e.coli or food poisonining. I was fine.

If you suffer from HA the only way to deal with it is by seeing a therapist. Going to your GP about your symptoms only deals with those symptoms and new ones will show up couple of months later and the cycle will continue.
Coming on this board and asking if other people suffer the same symptoms as you doesn't really help you because you will develop new symptoms and worry again.
Everybody has different bowel movement frequency or consistency and is not qualified to diagnose your BM change.
Googling your symptoms will almost always make you think you have cancer, diabetes, STD, MS, or another serious disease.
Accept the fact that we are dealing with a global pandemic and you have more stress and anxiety which will cause more symptoms.
Stop thinking that people who are not medically trained can diagnose you and everything will be okay.
HA happens because there is literally some chemical imbalance which starts a domino effect and trying to deal with it without addressing the core problem will always end up bad. This imbalance can happen from some traumatizing incident, social life, work, financial status, or many other things.

372,2020-10-19T14:12:33+00:00,coordinatedflight,Your stress will accumulate.,"One thing I’ve learned in the last 6-7y with HA: stress is cumulative.
I feel anxiety through the lens of health. But it’s not just symptoms that trigger my health anxiety.
Conflict with my wife. My child yelling after not getting what he wants. Financial stress. Logistics of a pandemic. Being concerned about my children’s’ development. The basic day-to-day stress of having too much to do and too little time to do it. An election year. Financial footwork.
All of these stressors - none of them health related - result in an increased underlying “baseline” of stress. And that translates into higher levels of health anxiety. New symptoms to be worried about, or familiar ones coming back to convince me i was wrong the last time I overcame them.
If you recognize when you are stressed, perhaps you can’t immediately desires. But it can help you prepare for the anxiety that will follow.
Try to design your life in a way that redirects those stressful things into a positive direction, or cuts them out entirely.
Even though it’s not going to have a direct impact on your physical health, you may find it helps with your baseline anxiety, which may bring those sensations back under control.",92,Create an account,https://old.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/je2cwm/your_stress_will_accumulate/,,,,,1,208,37.75,45.74,76.58,1,10.95,11.54,1.92,8.65,7.21,0,6.25,6.25,0,0,0,12.98,3.85,0.96,0,0.48,0.48,0.48,8.65,2.4,0,0.48,0.48,0.48,0.48,0,0,0.96,0,0,0,0.96,0,4.81,3.85,0.48,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.96,0.96,0,0,0,4.81,1.92,4.33,3.85,18.27,9.13,2.4,0,0,2.88,3.85,0
373,2020-08-13T08:44:08+00:00,Blergh985,I actually did it - I snapped myself out of a spiral,"Hi all. 
So, some context. Long time sufferer with racing thoughts related to health, largely spurred from having lost 8 family members in the last 10 years. Bit of a death complex.. It sucks, but hey ho. I'd wager that 80% of the 'symptoms' I have are anxiety/stressed induced.
This year, after 9 years of suffering, I decided to try to work on myself and all the things I didn't like or didn't feel like I had control of. I lost 25kg, I fixed my crappy posture, I came out to my friends and family, I started drinking less and doing less drugs as a coping mechanism.
Last night I'm laying in bed and I'd probably eaten quickly and late in the evening, so I had some digestive issues. There I went, diagnosing myself. It was covid, it was stomach cancer. I reached for my phone to start googling symptoms. But I didn't grab it. I decided I didn't want to spend hours doing that.
I think I've made really small, incremental changes in my life, which are really slowly filtering over to my anxiety and depression. I have a hell of a long way to go, but hell, I've come this far. For all you sufferers out there, pick one tiny thing to work on and note your progress. It might not work for you. For me, seeing small improvements in myself boosted my overall happiness. My responses to my anxiety have become better as a result.  No doubt at some point today I'll go full spiral, but I've proven I CAN do it and I think it might be through taking the terrifying plunge to change.

My mind was filled with thoughts that told me I was going to die soon from lung cancer, simply because I had a cough. There were adverts for lung cancer that were (coincidentally) showing up more often at that time, so my innocent little mind convinced myself it was a sign I’m suffering from lung cancer and/or other diseases. It was scary sitting through all these thoughts on my own, I didn’t tell my family how I was feeling because I felt embarrassed for feeling this way, and scared they’d rush me to the doctors. At some point, my 9-year old self wouldn’t even believe I’d get to 10 (obviously I did, and I’m just so grateful I made it all the way past 10 years old without dying from an undiagnosed disease that I’m always thinking about)  Thankfully though, throughout the years my anxiety has only just gotten better and I only get these thoughts occasionally.

381,2020-11-30T16:09:34+00:00,MyPinkElephants,How I beat Hypochondria,"Note: There really is no ""beating hypochondria"" or ""beating anxiety"". It is a disorder and there are a lot of things you can do to learn to live with it and happily too.
Backstory: I have had anxiety since I was in pre-school and didn't know it until I was an adult. My hands would feel like they were blowing up like a balloon and I couldn't breathe. When I entered my 20's it turned more into hypochondria. I did not know what was wrong with me and I just figured that I was strange. I didn't even know what anxiety really was. I thought it was just nervousness before an interview. I had a child in my early 20's and went through post partum depression, hypochondria, anxiety, depersonalization and derealization. I've had ER visits, more EKGs than I can count, a heart monitor and countless therapy sessions all pointing to good health. 
These are some tips I recommend, please feel free to comment if you need further clarification or if you have any addition questions! Feel free to add what has helped you as well!  :)
Age
I feel like my anxiety was at its worst when I was in my 20's. The brain doesn't fully develop until age 25 so I feel there is a lot your body and brain are going through. You can't avoid age but maybe knowing that it's worse when you're younger can be comforting. I didn't start feeling like I was in control until my early 30's. 
Knowledge
I recommend NOT educating yourself with WebMD or other sources that are similar. The internet can be extremely helpful in many different ways but it can harm you too. When I had a heart palpitation or my arm felt weird or I had an icepick headache I would go straight to Google. A part of hypochondria is that helpless search to find out what is wrong. We are so in-tune with our bodies we want to know exactly what is wrong. Why did I just have that pain or twitch? So we Google it to hopefully find out something that will comfort us and we usually find something bad. Re-assuring yourself by checking your pulse is the same exact thing. Write down your symptoms in a journal or note app and come back to them later. Make it a goal to not Google or pulse check for that day. It's hard at first but try to write it down, take 10 DEEP breaths and engage yourself in a distracting activity.
Diet
What you eat is VERY important with how your brain and body works. Here are some anxiety triggering foods: https://www.eatthis.com/foods-make-anxiety-worse/
Caffeine is a huge trigger for me. I learned that there are foods with natural caffeine in them that I must stay away from as well like chocolate and acaii berries. I went vegan (I do not recommend this for you but it is what I decided to do), which is not for everyone but if you cut out processed foods, sugars (not natural sugars like fruits) caffeine and alcohol it can have a great effect on your body and mind. (Taking vitamins that help with anxiety could help you as well - magnesium, B-12, Omega-3)
Health
You should get a yearly checkup of course, but if you go to the ER or clinic a few times a week there is a problem. At one point I had 6 EKGs in the span of 6 months (once a year is recommended) and I was checking my blood pressure at a public machine almost daily. I never had a bad EKG reading. Again, we go to the doctor for re-assurance when we actually should be more assuring with ourselves. If you have a cold, or you have a high fever, a cough or internal pain for days yes, go to the doctor. But you need to start remembering all of your previous symptoms. I cannot tell you how many times I have thought ""Okay, I have felt weird like this before, but THIS time is REALLY weird"" and I freak myself out and truly believe that THIS time is different than the other times I felt off. This is something you have to remember in your head. ""I have felt this way before or similar and I was fine"" ""This time may be different but I will get through it just like last time and the time before that"". This is where your journal will help, you can review all the times you were having anxiety about something and see all the attacks you survived.
Hormones
This section is really only for people who have menstrual cycles. Your hormones peak during ovulation as well as when you are on your cycle. I notice my anxiety is higher on ovulation days. Here is a guide: https://www.myhormonology.com/how-do-your-hormones-affect-anxiety/
Constructive Worrying
Switch your worrying to constructive.
""What if there's something wrong with my heart?"" - ""What if my heart is fine?""
""What if the doctor says I have a disease?"" - ""What if he tells me I am healthy?""
Quick Fixes
Physical sensations are very hard to get through. You physically feel a palpitation, your heart racing, your head feels weird, you have a strong pinch in your arm. You actually feel them so they immediately put your brain in a bad mindset. Palpitations are not dangerous unless you are a newborn, elderly, or having them constantly throughout the day for several days. Whenever I have one I think about what I just did that could have caused it. I might be going through a stressful situation, thinking about a stressful thing, maybe I drank no water that day or maybe I just ate something with alcohol or caffeine. Exercise, not drinking enough water or being sick with a fever and cough can cause a palpitation too.

Think about what you just ate, thought about or physically did that could have cause a sensation

Constructive Worrying
BAAR (Breathe, Accept, Acknowledge, Release) *This is something I made up while going through depersonalization. (Breathe in deep, accept the anxiety sensation or thought, acknowledge it happened, Release your breath and your thought*

Conclusion
You have hypochondria which is an anxiety disorder and you can learn to live with it comfortably. You might even get to a point where it is laughable when you get a symptom. Remember your history of getting through all those times you thought you'd never get through it. Remember that it is the disorder that makes it hard for you. Acceptance really does help. I am in my 30's now and I do still have days that have anxiety but I remember how many years I suffered thinking and worrying this way and I take my breaths, maybe make some tea and move on. You are not alone, no matter how weird or foggy your brain makes you feel. 
You have an amazing brain! You just need a little tweaking with your health anxiety but you'll get through it, just like you have before :)",93,Create an account,https://old.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/k3yrft/how_i_beat_hypochondria/,,,,,1,1218,12.95,40.06,91.3,15.63,18.45,6.16,2.87,3.28,3.04,0.66,2.3,1.56,0,0.08,0,10.34,2.87,0.66,0.08,0.08,0.33,0.82,7.39,0.08,0.08,0,0.08,0.74,0,0,0.74,1.07,0.49,0,0.57,0,0,8.62,3.61,0.57,0.41,0.74,0.49,0.08,1.81,0,0.49,0.16,1.23,0.08,0.16,0,5.5,4.52,5.99,1.07,14.45,4.68,3.37,0.41,0.25,1.48,4.27,0

i am reasonably young, healthy, active, etc., so when i get a ""symptom"" of some looming catastrophe that can very reasonably be attributed to anxiety, i make a conscious effort to assume it IS only anxiety. 
for me, i experience shortness of breath, chest tightness or pain, numbness of arms or lips, twitches, sour stomach, blurry vision, throat tightness, and others; all of these can be caused by anxiety. for me, deciding to assume it is only anxiety and tell myself so has gone a long way to me moving through the symptoms and getting back to life.
of course, this is coupled with no googling whatsoever, no trips to the ER or the doc without good cause, etc.
i'd rather assume it's anxiety and run the minuscule risk that i am some wild outlier than assume i'm the wild outlier and ruin day after day with all-consuming worry.
if you have reason to believe you're healthy and well, maybe this little mantra can help you, too.

398,2021-02-14T17:22:55+00:00,Upbeat-Caterpillar-5,My story with HA,"(TW for mentioning specific diseases) 
Hey, y'all. So, things are starting to flair up again, so I think just writing everything down will really help. 
I've always been anxious about my health. I had my first panic attack when I was 11, and the symptoms of it had me begging my mom to take me to the hospital for weeks after the fact. 
Well, I'd been managing it pretty well. Maybe an occasional superfluous trip to the doctor here and there, but nothing so major it fully impacted my day-to-day life. 
Well, the morning of March 18th, 2020, a few weeks before my 22nd birthday, I woke up, and yellow fluid ran out of my nose. It was neon yellow, nothing I'd ever seen before. I'd been an allergy sufferer my entire life, but this was new. This was terrifying. 
Instantly, I was a Google Dr., and I had a diagnosis: CSF Leak. My brain was leaking fluid. It all made so much sense! I had every symptom! I was dizzy, and my back hurt! That had to be the explanation! 
By the time March 21st rolled around, I had seen 4 doctors, including an emergency room visit. I saw a different doctor everyday. They all told me the same thing: Allergies. You have a sinus infection. Take an anti-biotic. Obviously, they were wrong! I had a life-threatening disease! They just thought I was too anxious to take me seriously. 
One, though, as he looked at my charts and saw this was my 4th trip in 4 days, looked at me and said, ""I'm writing you a referral to our neurology team. If your brain is leaking anything, they'll find it."" Then, he told me what every HA sufferer dreads to hear, ""Also, I think it would help you to speak with a therapist."" 
That was it! He wrote it in my charts! The largest provider of Healthcare in my state knew I was crazy. They would never take me seriously again, and I was going to die. 
I went home. The Neurology appointment was two weeks away. COVID had shut my job down. So. What did I do? 
I slept. 
For two weeks, if I wasn't asleep, I was begging my husband not to go to work. I was begging him to stay with me, in case I didn't wake up. After five days of this, his gentle, soothing demeanor waned. He would wake up and leave the room. Say nothing more to me than, ""Please eat something today."" and ""You need a shower. Please try to take one today."" or ""Have you checked on your Animal Crossing Island lately? Why don't you see how it's doing."" He did what he could from arms length, but I wasn't the woman he married, and the start of the pandemic was especially brutal for him. 
The Neurology appointment turned up clear. The doctor sent me along for an MRI, just to soothe my worries. The MRI date was 3 weeks away. 
By this point, my symptoms had grown much worse. Turning my head too suddenly made me extremely dizzy. I'd be hit with sudden waves of nausea. My back and shoulders ached, and, most damning, an excruciating pressure headache that felt as if someone had wrapped a rubber band around the bridge of my nose. 
I was getting worse, and every day, I wanted to just die already, just so I wouldn't have to feel this anymore. 
My husband of 3 months took care of me. I literally cannot overstate the difference this guy made. I'm sure, in January 2020, standing at the altar, he would have never imagined, just a few short months later, he'd be coming home from a soul crushing, impossibly difficult job, waking me up, and sitting with me to make sure I ate something that day.  I was a zombie. I completely withdrew from everyone. My own mom called me crazy. 
Every time my husband pulled away from me, disengaged to take a break, I grew angry. Resentful. Couldn't he see? I was dying. I was dying, and he didn't care! He wasn't worried at all! 
I wanted to die. I wanted to die so badly. If I hadn't been so absolutely terrified of it, I would have done it myself. 
The MRI came and went. My results? Clear. Totally, and completely clear. Nothing. There was nothing wrong with me. 
If that was true, why was I feeling these things? I wasn't making them up!!! I could barely stand for longer than 30 minutes! I was weak, shakey, unable to communicate clearly. My sharp wit was dull and I couldn't perform the basic tasks! Surely, I was in cognitive decline. I needed more tests. I needed more. Just to be sure. They had missed something, and I was dying!
When I brought this up to my husband, he took my hand, and said, ""Tomorrow's your birthday. Can we try celebrating?"" 
I had forgotten about my own birthday.
After a day of slow-paced celebrating, I booked an appointment with a therapist. 
Slowly but surely, I got better. 
My symptoms subsided. I was awake during the day, if only for a few hours. I started eating regular meals. I showered and brushed my teeth and just. Existed. I was a living human person again. 
Instead of immediately bombarding my husband with my anxiety, I listened. I listened to how hard work had been. How he had also started going to therapy. How had I missed that? 
I had lost 2 months of my life, and I was angry. I was so angry. So, I decided never again! I would do whatever I had to to make sure this never happened again. 
Which brings us back to why I'm writing this. 
I've always had stress related heart palpitations. I've had my heart checked, and there's nothing wrong with it. Since they're such a regular occurrence for me, they're usually easy to ignore. Now, I gained 50 lbs over quarantine (when I got my appetite back, it was ravenous and unforgiving), so, my clothes are a little tight. 
The combination of my usual heart palpitations and the squeeze of my old bra sent me spiraling into a heart-related panic attack. I spent all day yesterday in a dizzy, headachey, brain-foggy haze, ignoring everything I knew. 
Yes, my heart palpitations get worse when I'm stressed. Yes, my brain has put me in an incredibly stressful situation, triggering heart palpitations. The HA monster that sits in all of our brains, though? He was adamant that I was experiencing a major heart attack and could die at any second. Everything came back, and, suddenly, I was begging my husband not to go to work again. 
Yesterday, I was dizzy, weak, and afraid. 
This morning, I got out of bed, and wrote this.  I do not care what it takes. I am not doing this again. 
So, for those of you who made it this far, thank you. I promise you, there are people out there who know what you're going through, people who have been there, and are there. You aren't alone.
One day, you will wake up and see how far you've come. One day, you will wake up, and everything will feel like a distant nightmare. 
Hold onto that feeling. That triumph is what will push you through to the other side. 
You're going to make it. You will be ok.
Thank you.",87,Create an account,https://old.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/ljspqs/my_story_with_ha/,,,,,1,1246,9.8,5.84,93.72,3.64,9.51,5.38,1.44,3.69,2.33,0.16,2.01,1.28,0.32,0,0.08,9.71,3.45,0.8,0.32,0.24,0.24,1.44,6.02,0.72,0,0.24,2.01,0.08,0,0,0.08,2.33,0.16,0.48,1.12,0.4,0.16,7.22,3.85,1.52,0,0.4,0,0,0.4,0.72,1.04,0.24,1.2,0,0.08,0.16,6.5,11.24,2.49,1.69,23.52,8.75,8.03,0.64,1.36,2.73,2.01,0

407,2020-01-08T20:18:18+00:00,KLoSlurms,I want to give back by sharing my story.,"I don't make my own reddit posts but I feel like I need to for other people.
A little background: I'm a psychotherapist (weird, I know), who has a sad history of health anxiety, sometimes cancer but mostly devastating neurological diseases.
When I was in graduate school, and I had very hard internship at a hospital. I remember my first (now looking back) panic symptom that was odd. My vision was blurry. Hm.
At my first therapy job I noticed eye pain as well. Now, looking back, I was very stressed and the florescent lighting is trash. But, I researched, and wouldn’t you know it? Eye pain is an MS symptom. I’m a white woman in my 20’s. Uh-oh, that’s the main demographic. I’m in trouble. I keep googling and as I see symptoms I start to get those symptoms. They don’t come and go, they are CONSTANT. My face on one side and my arm on one side are numb. All. The. Time. 4AM? Numb. I cry all the time, go to neurologists, have many tests, rack up bills. No MS. I see a psychiatrist, was prescribed Lexapro, and within a few weeks my life is back to normal. Shouldn’t say this was simple because I cried for months, and would vomit every morning out of sheer panic. But, it’s behind me. I take the meds for 3 years, then decide I can stop.
I should note that in between this event and the next, I had smaller events and went to doctors for them, always was nothing. But, then..
A year later something happens. One day I notice my hand feels weird. It’s like my typing is clumsy. I spend 4 hours on ALS forums reading people’s experiences. I watch youtube videos of diagnoses. Oh no. This is it. My muscles start twitching uncontrollably. I have cramps in my legs, in my hands, every day. I cry all the time. I plan my death. I tell my fiancé he should probably move on, that we shouldn’t have the wedding because the money would be better saved for care. I go to the doctor, he says I seem fine. He reads my medical records and sees I have health anxiety. Says I can see a neurologist if I want, but it’ll probably be a waste. Puts me back on Lexapro. My fiancé also insists that I start therapy. I believe it’s a waste because I’m dying, but fine.
Every morning I wake up nauseous, sobbing, hands cramped. I read and read and read. I see my hand is smaller on one side. I’m wasting away. I lose lots of weight, and can barely do any work. I see a neurologist, practically crawling to the office because I feel so weak. When she tests my reflexes, they are hyper. Another symptom. I immediately burst into tears. She tries to assure me that a lot of young people, and anxious people, have hyper reflexes, but I’m hearing none of it. We schedule an MRI and have a follow up in a month.
The weeks waiting for the medication to kick in are BRUTAL. Everyone needs to know that SSRIs have bad side effects in the initial weeks, including increased anxiety (I know, right?). You have to understand that it takes a long time to build in your system, you have to be patient. This is where the therapy comes in. We used CBT which really maps out your greatest fears, the likelihood of that outcome, and your ability to cope with that outcome. We look at the FACTS. I am not a doctor. This is incredibly rare. Surely I would’ve gotten worse by now. I don’t feel my hand is messed up when I’m drinking alcohol (my favorite health anxiety hack—drink and see if you still have the problem! lol). I start doing yoga in my office even though I suck at it, because I just want to feel better.
Self-talk is very dangerous. You need to watch the messages you're playing in your head. I told myself ""I know it. I know"" over and over again. It's like your own personal health anxiety flavored brain washing. I changed it to ""It feels like. It feels like"". And like my therapist said, Feelings aren't Facts. 
The 24/7 panic stops, but I’m still worried. I follow up with my primary, he says I’ve gained some weight back and look a lot better. I see the neurologist again, and she notes the same. I was prepared mentally for this appointment with an agenda. I said,
“I trust you. If you say I should get an EMG, I will. If you think I shouldn’t, I won’t”.
She said “consider this a clean bill of health. I don’t think you need an EMG”.
I give her a hug, thank her for being so kind, and move on with my life. I am not allowed to google this anymore. Point blank period. I thanked my friends for dealing with me during this time, and now I just cope with some bummer side effects from the Lexapro, but I don’t care. I have my life back.
My therapy moved to twice a month, and I still take the medication. My muscles twitch sometimes and.. oh well! Not as much as before. More evidence that it was stress related. Logic is your friend. I hope that you can pull some nuggets from this post, including how symptoms can seem VERY real, and yet, not be real.
I’ll leave you with this. One of my dearest friends (also a therapist) said to me, “You know, you’re really smart. So your anxiety is smart too. Of course it picked a disease that you can’t easily prove you don’t have!”

Im a 19 year old guy with left side pain/sharpness for some days now, I know its kind of common since the reason this is happening could be anxiety but still the sharpness is pretty disturbing.  
This one night I was chilling texting my friend when all of a sudden a sharp pain hit me in my chest (left side) it was pretty painful to be honest and eventually went away after like 5 minutes but ever since I've been experiencing sharpness from time to time and it kinda gets better when I lay on my back but even when I forget about it, a disturbing sharp pain hits me. Also I find that my heart beats faster than usual and especially when taking the stairs or something like that my heart races. I wouldnt be as concerned if this happened while I was running or exercising since it would mean its probably a muscular pain. From time to time I even have left shoulder pain and some kind of dizziness but once again, I think this is just my anxiety playing games with me, I mean it could be a heart problem you never know but Im a non-smoker and I never drink alcohol, as far as I know no one in my family had heart problems this early in life but Im not ruling anything out just yet till I visit a doctor, which I probably will in the upcoming days, so I just wanted to ask you guys who experienced this for any sort of advice on how to try and calm down and will the pain ever go away, I tried pain killers but nothing helped to be honest.

I’ve spend this last year having a ton of visual disturbances. I have had an intense eye exam including an OCT and my eye doctor has assured me that nothing is wrong, and my issues are anxiety related. My retina, optic nerve, blood vessels and everything have been checked. He told me I need to try to take the focus off of my vision but I’m finding this to be impossible. My issues include:
-when I wake up or go from the dark to a bright room my vision flickers/flashes when blinking it moving my eyes 
-normal floaters, along with 3 very small “floaters” in my right eye, I can only see them in bright conditions but they look like very small orbs or bubbles in my central vision that don’t move out of the way or float like a normal floater. Instead they move with my eye when I move it. 
-I experienced a strange bright blob in my vision off to the side of my right eye, like the afterimage of a camera flash, and could see it every time I blinked for about an hour. It faded away. A day later it happened again in the Center of my vision but that time only lasted a few seconds. 
-when closing one eye and looking at a bright surface with the other I see small flashes of light 
-if I close my left eye and try to read something on my phone with my right eye I see a blurry spot. As I’m reading it’s as if a small blurry blob follows after the words I’m reading. 
anyone who has experienced similar issues? 
if so how did you stop focusing on them?

1. You are more likely to get the flu or a common cold than the coronavirus. 
2. Your chances of getting the coronavirus are extremely low, especially if you havent been to china within the past month. 
3. Most of the people who have died have had other underlying health issues or were older. 
4. All of the cases in the US were people who traveled to Wuhan. There have been no reports of human to human transmission in the US. 
5. Say you do get the coronavirus. Most people get mild cold/flu symptoms. 
6. Wash your hands. Use hand sanitizer. Stay hydrated. Eat right. DONT FUCKING GO TO SCHOOL/WORK IF YOURE SICK!!! It will help stop the spread of germs!!! 
7. Get your fucking flu shot. 
None of you are going to die from the coronavirus. The flu kills more people each year (mainly the elderly/children/ people with compromised immune systems).

Here are a few of my theories:

It’s a particularly gruesome way to die and the descriptions of it are terrifying.
There’s no test that can rule it out.
The media sensationalizes the hell out of the rare cases that do pop up.
Sources like the CDC write from the perspective of getting people to take the shot, not assuaging fear of the disease itself, ditto web md and all other health info sites.

Sometimes both issues start to settle down and I’m so used to suffering with them and worrying about that I’m going to die from them, that i start looking for other things to worry about, if I have like a slight red patch of skin, I start to worry its cancer. I even start looking at parts of my body which have been like that forever and start to think its now something serious, like a bone or something which is feeling weird or like anything which i think maybe wrong and then start googling it and come to the conclusion I’m dying. 
If I find a spot in a weird place, I start to worry, if my back starts to hurt, I think I have something serious, if I get a headache something is wrong! Etc and then I google this and then convince myself I’m dying.
I spend most the days trying to find something else to worry about, ironically being this anxious about it, actually causes physical symptoms to come back including my fatigue and then I just worry about I’m clearly dying as I have fatigue.
I’ve been like this all my life, since i was young, ive convinced myself many times I’m diabetic and then have blood tests which show I’m not, and then convinced myself i was dying of bowel cancer and then had a colonoscopy and turns out I’m not.  Currently worried i may have stomach cancer due to my LPR :)

427,2020-08-15T21:58:22+00:00,unitcodes,Anxiety over death brings symptoms.,"This will be a rather long post. It would really mean a lot if you would take the time to read it through and comment.
I am a 42 year old male, currently living in Sweden with my wife. So this all started 14 years ago, when my mother passed away in leukemia. Before that happened, i could not care less about my existense and death was never in my thoughts. 
But after she had passed away, although i was convinced she was going to make it, the anxiety just rushed over me. I felt incredible stressed and this warm intense feeling just flooded me. I got tinnitus from nowhere, and that really freaked me out. I remember just sitting in front of my computer, and suddenly this sharp intense sound started in my left ear from nowhere. I panicked and just went outside walking around for hours in the cold winter night. 
On top of that, i got this strange feeling of my surroundings. It was like i didnt recognize the world anymore. I remembered looking at people walking round and felt incredible insecure. It was like i couldnt understand why these people are walking around and why the things happened around me. I also got really bad sleeping problems, and became really afraid of the dark. I did not sleep a full night for a period of 2 months. 
Under this period i also got sudden chest pains, and i was convinced it was a heart attack. Again, walking it off seemed to help and the pain was gone for now. 
I was totally fine for 14 years, and during these years i had not had a single episode of anxiety attacks. 
Fast forward to today 2020, and my wife told me that a relative in her family was having a big setback on his cancer. 
And guess what, yes the famous anxiety came back. All the things i had struggled with came back in a matter of one or two days. Its strange, it doesnt appear right away when you hear about it. You just suddenly feel the anxiety rush through your body and everything is different. The whole life and surroundings feel totally strange and scary. 
I use to compare this feeling with waking up on a different planet, with no friends and everyone is a stranger. 
But this second time i got smarter and realize the big mistake i did 14 years ago, was to not talk to someone. I tried to explain the feelings for my father, but i guess hearing these things just sounds like total bullshit if you are not facing them yourself. 
So i went and talked to a professional psychologist, and it really helped. But he told me that i needed to find the reason for my anxiety attacks. Yes, the first time its obvious it was the loss of my mother. But i feel i can handle it better now, and also mention it to people without having anxiety attacks. 
It took a while but now i am sure of what my second time anxiety comes from. The fact that i someday is going to die, and not exist anymore just freaks and scares the living crap out of me. Everytime i think about this, the familiar warm rushing feeling is appearing in my arms and in my stomach. I also get this depressing feeling, and is feeling that nothing is fun or worth doing since i am going to die anyway. 
We also have a baby on the way which i feel is truly amazing and fantastic in any way. It is really exciting, and the thought of becoming a dad is truly refreshing. But at the same time, this feeling of knowing that i someday will be gone is incredible overwhelming. I am truly really afraid of dying and not be able to do fun things with my amazing family. 
I will talk about this with a psycologist. I really hope he or she can help me get out of this negative and depressing spiral. 
Also, if anyone has or is experiencing the same things, dont hesitate to comment. It would really help to get to know more people facing the same problems.

428,2019-03-14T01:22:24+00:00,socsrocks,Positive thinking for others whose HA is cancer based (the what ifs),"So my health anxiety is almost entirely grounded in cancer. Today I’m worried about lymphoma and brain cancer. A month ago it was lung and digestive cancer(s). Before that leukemia and before that bone cancer. You get the gist. 
My dad was diagnosed with cancer and did pass away from it. Before you freak out, he was older, active but poor poor diet his whole life. History of alcoholism. I mention this because it’s good context for my issues. My health anxiety spirals every year around this time (Jan-Mar) when he was sick. 
Even though I know many many statistics, about age of diagnosis and general health and this and that, it doesn’t always stop the worrying, as many of you are well aware. 
I tend to catastrophise. If I feel bad, it must be cancer, and since it’s cancer, I’ll die a painful death in a couple months. 
I typically avoid cancer stories as they trigger me up pretty badly (duh) but today I stumbled across a story of a 27 year old guy who was diagnosed with a rare brain cancer a few months ago. Today he announced he was cancer-free. 
The world isn’t perfect, and it isn’t always fair. There are lots of what ifs. But I think it’s so so so important to remember the what ifs are conjecture and NOT fact. 
So you go through the thing, your lymph nodes are swollen. You’re probably a little sick with a cold, or maybe you’ve been poking your neck non stop for weeks to check. So you probably don’t have lymphoma. Okay, but what if you do? Honestly, you’d probably be fine. This is not ALWAYS the case. But if we go by percentages, 99% of your worries are not cancer, or malignant, or serious at all. 75% of that 1% of real and serious conditions respond well to treatment. There’s variance but this is a great time in history to have cancer. Treatments are so plentiful and effective. Maybe you DO have brain cancer, but so? That 27 year old kid did. He’s alive and well. 
To be abundantly clear, I think it’s most important to challenge false conclusions, first and foremost. Challenge your worries. If you’re in a rut though, and you just can’t shake the feeling that “THIS TIME is has to be cancer, I just know it has to be”: stay optimistic! We are a community of worriers. Challenge yourself to think of best case scenarios, even if they’re within the worst case. 
I’m here with you, if you’re scared of something today. And I’m so positive that we will get through it just fine, I want you to be positive of that as well :)",87,Create an account,https://old.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/b0u868/positive_thinking_for_others_whose_ha_is_cancer/,,,,,1,466,8.9,48.99,74.06,28.85,12.26,7.51,4.08,3.43,3.22,0.64,2.58,1.5,0,0,0,9.01,0.86,0,0,0,0,0.86,7.94,0.21,0,0,1.72,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.44,7.08,4.08,0.21,0.21,0,0,0,0.86,0,0.21,0.43,0.43,0.43,0,6.44,3.43,7.73,1.72,21.46,7.3,5.15,0.43,0.21,4.51,3.86,0

It's so bizarre. Everything just comes rushing back, like myocolonus (jerking awake during sleep due to hyperawareness), excessive thirst, what feels like fibromyalgia and travelling pains, etc... It's so crazy, to know that it's all simply because of psychosomatic/mental fixation... Being human can be freakish when we deconstruct our desensitization, and that's exactly part of why we panic and worry. Personally, I'm sure existential crises are a huge part of why I have health anxiety lol. Like, knowing how insane and fully unpredictable life/the human condition is, knowing how out of our control things can really be, the delicate fragility of life, the great unknown in the afterlife, etc... I truly don't get why/how most people DON'T have health anxiety and/or panic disorder.
HOWEVER, it's been getting easier and easier to diffuse the panic and anxiety, and even if I'm relapsing, my relapses aren't nearly as bad as it first was last summer, and for that I am extremely grateful, and I'm eager to keep a positive outlook and improve my coping strategies! 
Hell, just keep distracting the heck out of yourself with healthy, nuturing experiences. Fulfill yourself. Don't self-sabotage. Love who you are. I truly notice a huge difference in every facet of my life when I take care of myself and practice self-care in every way, and especially mitigate self-sabotage.

441,2020-12-03T01:29:04+00:00,Hellotherebruhbruh,"Im cured, didn't need therapy or meds :)","(Tldr at bottom) Hello friends, just wanted to say goodbye to this sub. Sorry for the long post, but I thought I'd share my journey with you all, since it was always gave me hope when someone else talked about how they overcame this.
My HA was really severe for a few months. There would be days where all I could do was suffer in my own head, and it was impossible for me to distract myself even for a second. Several days at a time would be just constant intense anxiety, pacing around my room, and thinking about how I'm going to die. The few seconds right after I woke up was my only relief, until I remembered my fear and everything came crashing down again. Even on good days I would spend hours and hours wasting my life away because being productive would bring my anxiety back.
Ultimately, there were two things that helped me out a lot. The first may not help you depending on your current fear, but I saw a specialist and asked her lots of questions. She didn't even go through with any tests because there wasn't anything that looked concerning. Understanding exactly what they look for and when my symptoms would be something to investigate further was really really helpful to me. As for how you can apply it to your situation, just be open with discussing your concerns in depth with a medical professional.
The main thing that actually cured me was triggered by some reddit post, actually. It was a news article about how some country was legalizing shrooms for treating depression. I read through the comments and there were stories of how doing shrooms just once was enough to cure them. For once in their life, they were finally able to enjoy being in the moment and everything around them was just beautiful. The experience just flipped their mindset around and changed their life for the better.
I kind of took this to heart and thought I could apply the same principles to myself (without the shrooms,) so I went outside to take a walk and do some ""mental cleansing."" It was like 3 AM and really cold, but I think it was better that way since it was a beautiful night with nobody around. First I rationalized that I can't live my life in fear - whatever happens is out of my control, but until then I have to be strong, for myself and people I care about. Realizing this fear is irrational is so important. This is not who I want to be. I want to be someone that is strong no matter what happens.
Then, I just lived. I admired the stars and the trees, the christmas lights on houses around me, felt the cold wind in my face. Everything was beautiful. The world is beautiful. Sure, there is hate and disease, but there's also love and life, I didn't want to be blinded to that anymore. In that moment, I just enjoyed now. Nothing else mattered except the sensations around me and the beauty of life and nature, and all my worries melted away. It's sort of hard to describe exactly how I felt, but I hope I got my point across.
Now, I feel normal and it's amazing. I truly feel that I can take on whatever life throws at me. At one point I spent a few hours intentionally reading triggering reddit posts and smiled at how they didn't affect me. In the end, my cure was within me this whole time, and I think all of your cures are buried deep down somewhere as well.
Sorry for the long post, but I don't really have anyone to share this with and it feels great to finally be free :)
Tldr; fix your mindset. All we have is right now, don't ruin that by living in the future.

No one could tell me I didn't have cancer, didn't have a blood clot, a brain tumor, etc. 
I was never like this. I can actually pinpoint the ""tipping moments"" that created this anxiety. Things are better now.
The stress that health anxiety brings is unlike anything I've ever experienced and to know that there are others like you guys that feel what I feel is reassuring and is like a light at the end of the tunnel.

I have been struggling with health anxiety issues for quite a while now. 
For the last 4-5 years it got to a point where I'm episodically decompensate. In these periods I spends days overthinking, researching and feeding my health anxiety. Small and probably normal body sensation are putting me in this loop. I get more stressed this leads to more symptoms and more anxiety.You guys propably know the drill....
The issue is a bit more complicated since I am a doctor myself. I have been working in a major hospitals for the last 9 years. It is a very stressful job but it also helps me get my mind of my anxiety at times.
But knowing alot about diseases is a good thing in the hospital but not so great when you are dealing with health anxiety....
In the last month's I haven't been working due to some career choices and that really turned my episodically anxiety attacks to a whole new level. 
I have been feeling like shit for weeks now. Barley leaving the house ( kinda good thing right now...) Feeling depressed and sick all day.
My main anxieties are around heart issues and autoimmune disorders. 
Anyway I just wanted to share with you guys my journey so far and really would like to hear what helped you?

457,2019-04-28T13:30:30+00:00,dumb_user_name,Heart Anxiety Realization,"So I have major HA and it’s mainly centered around heart issues. I’m 100% convinced my panic attacks are heart attacks, will deal with palpitations even though every cardiologist ever has said I’m fine, etc etc y’all know the drill. I am constantly running to the doctor because I just KNOW something is wrong with my heart, and he tests me for everything and always says “there’s literally nothing wrong here”. 
So yesterday I was headed to brunch with some friends. My chest starts hurting. I start panicking. I convinced myself that this was a heart attack, since I have no anxiety whatsoever about seeing my besties for mimosas. I tried to distract myself by laughing and joking with my friends and quietly tried to accept my fate that I will indeed die on this day from a heart attack. Luckily it was a short drive and we arrived at the restaurant before these thoughts could culminate more. 
It wasn’t until I got home that I realized the pain went away and I hadn’t even thought about it since arriving at the restaurant. The distractions of talking about the next episode of Game of Thrones, gossiping about celeb scandals, and trying to figure out which omelette to order had totally distracted me.
It’s experiences like these that show me just how anxious I really am/how strong my anxiety truly is. It’s present when I don’t even think it has a reason to be. I wasn’t having a heart attack—I was having anxiety. Still don’t know why, as I was genuinely looking forward to brunch, but that’s just another thing I need to work through and understand: my subconscious anxiety is causing these scary sensations. Those palpitations that come out of no where? That’s anxiety. Sharp chest pains that occur when I’m sitting down, watching TV? Anxiety. I don’t have to be faced with a typical “anxiety-inducing” event to struggle with the side effects of this disease.

459,2019-03-14T19:54:19+00:00,Comprehensive_Tip310,Anyone else experience anxiety/angina/heart attack symptoms for days on end?,"Quick info: Been to the ER probably 7 times since March of 2018 due to nearly every symptom you find when you look up anxiety, heart attack, and angina. Chest pain/pressure, left shoulder pain/discomfort, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, clammy hands/feet, etc. Each time, they do an EKG, xrays, and blood work that shows no sign of heart attack or damage to heart muscle. I even had a nuclear stress test done in August 2018 that came back negative as well.
To this day, I still experience the symptoms, but, as of the past week, the pain in the left side of my chest has been more constant and sharp. I've also been experiencing increased tingling and numbing from my right hand that extends all the way to the right side of my face that lasts for a minute or two and then goes away.
Another thing I will add is that I am a heavy drinker. I don't drink every day, but tend to go on binges that last several days. I am sure my alcoholism could be contributing to my condition, but I will still have these symptoms even on the days in between even when I haven't drank for weeks on end.
It doesn't seem feasible to keep going to the ER and getting stress tests, especially when I am uninsured.

Pay attention to my heart a lot and slight chest pains? Dr. Google: A heart attack. Or soon will be.
Problems with my stomach and gut? Dr. Google: Most likely an ulcer, colon cancer, and probably also all the other cancers you can get in those areas. 
Problems with my vision and eye floaters? Dr. Google: You WILL go blind soon. Or maybe tumor. DEFINITELY a tumor. 
And the prognosis to all of this? You will die a horrible, terrible death very soon.

To preface this, I am one of the worst hypochondriacs you'll ever meet. I obsess about all sorts of nasty illnesses that I am extremely unlikely to ever experience. I have wasted hundreds of hours on medical papers, websites, and many dollars on unnecessary medical expenses. 
The truth is that my obsession with illness is a symptom of a deeper existential crisis. I don't see any meaning in life other than actually being alive. Therefore, being alive and avoiding serious life-threatening illness is the highest possible goal within my frame of personal meaning. 
By preoccupying myself with health and with ill health, I feel that obsessing about these things is my only purpose because it achieves a continuation of living. But that ""achievement"" is to the detriment of actually enjoying my existence and immersing in it fully.

I'm only comparing the two because it makes me realize how silly I was being and that you have a far greater chance dying from covid, and dying from covid below the age of 30 is already extremely unlikely.
Based on Canadian statistics from the province of Ontario:
0.03% of my age group who contracted covid died (20 - 39). That is 1 in 3000. Google a  crowd of 3000, only 1 person will die from covid in that group.
Based on Israeli statistics (leading the world in vaccination):
0.0012%  of people who received their vaccine developed myocarditis (only 2  deaths, keep that in mind because that is significant) This is roughly 1  in 100,000. Google a crowd of 100,00 people. One person out of that crowd will develop myocarditis and that does not equal death.
Based on Israeli statistics (leading the world in vaccination):
0.00004%  of people who received the vaccine and developed myocarditis died and  there is still no CAUSAL link between the deaths and the vaccine.  That is astronomically low and you have a MUCH higher chance of walking  outside and dying from an external event.

490,2019-09-22T20:12:03+00:00,KayPet,A way to stop fixating on symptoms,"A fellow redditor posted a question about how to deal with fixating on symptoms and I decided to share my way. Perhaps it can be helpful to someone!
For me, once I fixate on a symptom, no form of distraction works. Reading, playing games, TV, nothing. The more I try to distract myself from it, the more I notice it. So I do these steps:

Accept that I'm experiencing a symptom (yes, I have a headache, yes, my heart palpitates) and remind myself it's just that - a symptom and not a full blown deadly condition like my anxiety makes it to be. 

.

Think of three different reasons why i may be experiencing this symptom that is NOT ABOUT DYING, aka ""I have a headache because I've stared at a screen for a few hours"", ""My heart is palpitating because I ate too much sugar/I'm dehydrated"" etc.

.

Try to focus on a reason behind the symptom that's NOT ABOUT DYING. Then try to do something about it if possible. If I tell myself my palpitations are from lack of water, I refill my water bottle. If I tell myself I'm dizzy because of the lack of fresh air, I go outside for a bit etc etc.

.

In some cases, when I am fixated to hell and back, I confess itt to someone. Like ""Hey, I'm feeling uneasy today and I'm fixated on these palpitations! I might speak stupid stuff for a bit"". I'm lucky I have close people who get me by now. If you're all alone, message us in this subreddit! :)

.

I then spend a few hours going ""what if its actually a heart attack tho"" to my friend to which they say ""no, it's alright, you're perfectly healthy. Its like fixating on yoir tongue in your mouth and suddenly it feels weird and restless and like something Is wrong"". I say all the crazy shit that this symptom makes me think. All of them, even the silly ones like ""what of palpitations are actually my heart preparing to stop?!"" Most of the time seeing someone else completely unbothered by my panicked thoughts make me relax because my friend would be actually worried if something WAS wrong. Them being calm shows me how crazy my anxiety makes it all to look like. Once I've said it all out loud its easier to stop rethinking the same things.

.

Next Time I fixate, my Friend goes ""you're perfectly fine, you've fixated on this before and you survived it! I was there and you were fine after a while, you'll be fine again"".

.
Sometimes when I start overthinking and going ""omg, why am i so dizzy"" my friend literally goes ""you were dizzy like this three weeks ago, water helped you last time, try that"". And it works. 
You can also make a Symptoms Diary and note whenever you get a symptom and how long it lasted, what helped it go away, when it comes back etc.
Once I knew my heart palpitations were mostly a symptom of too much sugar and not enough water I can somewhat help myself further on. 
My main point is, sometimes ignoring the symptom only makes it worse and actually facing it and your fear surrounding it is the only way to get through it. And that comes from someone who was SO fixated on their heart and breathing, that actually caused incredible stomach ache because I was breathing wrong for months because I couldn't stop fixating on the damn breathing.
I had to retrain myself how to breathe properly and to finally realise that fixating on a symptom is a symptom of itself. A symptom that my health anxiety is acting up (:

The number one golden rule of HA (y’all already know what’s coming)... never ever ever ever ever ever EVER Google anything. Resist the temptation and the urge. No matter what, do not give it. If you must pick up your phone, google something else, like “how to use reddit” lol (I’m new 😅) 
Stop looking for assurance in friends. It’s okay to talk about it if they ask you how you’re doing. But stop seeking that validation that you’re not dying. That’s almost as bad as Dr. Google himself. 
Unless you cannot breathe, are bleeding, are in excruciating pain, or something else incredibly severe, do not go to the emergency room. If you have a symptom and it’s scaring you, monitor it a bit (A LITTLE BIT, see #4) and see if it gets better or worse. Especially when you’re doing something... does the symptom go away when you’re busy and distracted? Anxiety. If the pain gets worse but you can still walk and talk? Book a doctors appointment. Chances are it’ll have gone away by then, and if not, you have something to talk about :P
Stop checking your symptoms at every moment. It’s a hard goal, but do it in steps. You’re only going to check 5 times today. Tomorrow 4. The next day 3. Remind yourself “okay, I’ve checked once today. I’ve got two more times”. It gets easier. 
Breathe. 
Love yourself. Give yourself words of affirmation. Tell yourself you are bigger than this. Look at the birds and how they fly about... no one takes care of them, no one feeds them. They don’t get medical check ups. And they are just flying around doing their thing. 
Don’t stop your life. I know sometimes the anxiety and/or depression can weigh you down so much that you physically cannot conceive even getting out of bed, but just try. Every step is a victory. 
Pray. Meditate. 
Get counselling. If money is an issue, look for resources. Your mental health is just as important as your physical health. It is worth it. 
Don’t be too hard on yourself if you break one of these rules. One day at a time. 

It’s such a struggle, and it’s going to be hard, especially in those days/moments where you can’t breathe. 
Where you’ve Googled a new fatal disease and you’re planning your funeral and picturing your loved ones’ lives without you. 
When you’ve turned to your friends and family asking them about your symptoms. 
When you’re feeling that old familiar rise of fear creeping into your body and you feel your throat getting smaller at the thought of the fact that you’ve got something awful wrong with you. 
When you go to the doctors and you feel like no one is listening and every one of them is telling you that you are fine, that it’s just stress, but you KNOW your body, you know what you feel, how could it be stress?? You don’t even feel that stressed?

That post was kinda the final straw for me, and I've decided to stay away from this place because it doesn't help, and has the opposite effect instead, which sucks",78,Create an account,https://old.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/j9tmsx/this_subreddit_is_no_longer_a_helpful_support/,,,,,1,157,17.93,1,97.86,79,39.25,8.92,6.37,2.55,1.91,0.64,1.27,1.27,0,0,0,8.92,5.1,3.82,0,0,0,0,3.18,0,0,0,0,2.55,0,0,2.55,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.27,1.27,0,1.27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.55,8.28,7.01,0,10.83,2.55,5.73,0,0,2.55,0,0

I often ask people instead of google about what’s wrong with me because I’d get better reassurance off of them. But it’s always the same ignorance. I wish everybody that didn’t have Health Anxiety would understand how mentally draining it is and how real the physics manifestations can be. My parents took it upon themselves to not allow me to go to therapy due to me being “silly” and it being something “I have to get over and fix myself”.

506,2021-03-22T01:00:56+00:00,jesswreck,One month of Google and measuring sobriety helped me heal SO much.,"Exactly one month ago, I decided not to use Google for health and body related topics anymore and exclude triggers from social media. It came to this point when I sneaked into my parent's bedroom to secretly grab a thermometer so that I could measure my body temperature because I couldn't go 2 hours without. I thought to myself ""this is not going to go any further"". I did not read or even engage in this subreddit for about 2 weeks now.      
That sobriety included googling
- food (positive and negative impacts)
- symptoms
- disease research
- ""normal"" body reactions like how body temperature changes over the day, how the menstrual cycle unfolds, normal heart rates while active,...      
I also didn't measure blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature (I measured all of those at least three times a day before).      
It wasn't easy. Especially on lonely evenings when anxiety hits hard. I broke my rule once (I measured my temperature when I felt real dizzy after I had just gotten my period). Other than that, here's what happened:     

1st: I had so much more time! Especially while being on my phone, I actually found myself thinking ""so, what do I do here?"". I picked up on my reading again. I got up and did shit without worrying that if I get up now my heart might be overwhelmed. I just did.      
2nd: SO much more brain capacity! I got excited about literature again, I took in whole books faster than I was breathing. I found myself being bored again, wanting to do stuff every single day. No full day of couch potatoing - not that a day like this can't be healing, but I just didn't need it.      
3rd: I worried less and less about my symptoms and they started to fade away. I'm not going to act like I'm free of the symptom-worry-spiral now, I'm definitely not. But it did get better, knowing that I just had to live with symptoms and would not act upon them and seek reassurement. I thought: if this ache is still in this exact spot in 2 days, I'll go see a doctor. Needless to say they disappeared after a few minutes.      
4th: (edited bc it's a more important point) I started to believe in myself and my future again. I could see myself in a normal working environment not being overwhelmed and stressed, but maybe even good at my future job. I found my way back to actually believing I'll not only be kind of okay but that I might have a bright future ahead of me. 
5th: I didn't have a single panic attack. I slept exceptionally well every night. I ordered in fish for the first time ever. I touched raw chicken. I didn't cancel anything, I even encouraged making plans with people. 

Thanks to this month, I understood that there actually is a way out. It's tough, but it's rewarding (and to be honest, most of the time it wasn't even tough except for some moments). I haven't gotten rid of this annoying disease but I know now that it doesn't have to be a downward spiral.      
I really hope that maybe some of you guys might have the same idea and that this text encourages you to just cut all of your safety seeking behavior out. Feel free to let me know if you tried something like this and how your sobriety turned out!

519,2019-07-14T21:49:33+00:00,Keir86,Health Anxiety - How it started and how I ended it quickly. My story,"I've recently got through health anxiety and wanted to use my experience to help others. I've waffled on a bit so if you don't want to read it all please just read the top 2 points as they are the key. I can guarantee reading this is better time spent than googling symptoms. 
Know your enemy
As you are on a health anxiety page you've likely had confusingly clear test results and already know your enemy isn't Cancer MS, HIV etc. It's anxiety.
Don't underestimate your enemy
Feeling physical symptoms that cannot possibly be anxiety? Wrong. The effects it can have on your body can be very physical, very painful, very scary and very real. 
I'll have to start my story part-way through. I was running up the stairs at work to get to my desk in time and slipped. I fell awkwardly on the hand rail and heard and felt a rib crack. Work was a nightmare and had been for weeks. I'd just become the manager of a new team and things were going wrong. I carried on up the stairs in pain and a few days later went to hospital. I had a chest Xray and they confirmed a fractured rib. Work got worse and my cat became very ill (and I really love my cat). 
Looking back all the signs were there months before this. Each time something stressful happened I got all hot, felt sick and lost my appetite. At the time I didn't think much of it. Then one morning everything changed. 
A couple of days later, I woke up with what felt like a burning hot hand squeezing my heart. I couldn't breathe properly as I started to panic. I ask my girlfriend to take me to the emergency department and I genuinely thought I was going to die. I even kissed my cat goodbye thinking I'd never see her again. I got seen straight away. After an ECG and blood tests and a few hours of waiting, my chest had settled but was incredibly tight. I was asked if I had eaten anything yet. As I got there at 6am I said no. I was given toast and paracetamol and told there was nothing wrong with me and was shortly after sent home. I think leaving without an answer was a real tipping point. 
I took 3 weeks off work and in that time my body and mind spiralled downwards. I kept catastrophizing. What if I get fired from my job? What if I can't work again and have to sell my house? What if I am seriously I'll…? And that one stuck. 
Meanwhile my body was malfunctioning all over the place. My bowel habits changed for the worse, my digestion was all wrong with reflux and heartburn. I felt so weak and light headed. Then overnight I developed excruciating back pain that radiated up my neck. I was sure now that the doctors had made a mistake and that my attack that day was something more. 
This carried on at varying degrees for months. Deep down I kind of felt I can't be that Ill as I went on holiday twice and felt a bit better when I was away. But then at it's worse I couldn't leave the house. I even text my girlfriend when she was at work to say I had a flesh eating skin disease. Now known as a blister in my toe...
I fell into the trap of googling symptoms and trying to use the internet for reassurance. I'd diagnose myself first with a stomach ulcer, then gallbladder disease then pancreatic cancer. New ones each week. Each time the doctor sent me for the tests which came back clear putting me back to square one believing it was me against the doctors who kept missing things. 
One day after I had made 4 diagnoses in one day I felt enough was enough and contacted a councillor who fitted me in that day. She took me to the beginning of the story.
I just wanted her to fix me and was puzzled why she was asking about recent bereavements. Earlier in the year I had been at a close relatives bed side when they died and my dad had a very risky operation that was 50/50 if he would make it. I thought I had dealt with that. I got back into my car after the therapy session and was in tears. Obviously I hadn't.
She also made me think about what my triggers were. My back ache had worn off a little in recent weeks. A stressful conversation with my boss on the phone and it was back with a vengeance. So the link in my brain was now correctly back ache due to anxiety rather than back ache due to randomly malfunctioning organ. 
I also went to my GP who put me on sertraline which is a commonly used antidepressant for anxiety. The side effects were difficult at first. In fact 3 days in I was having panic attacks but after a week the side effects subsided. After 4 weeks my physical symptoms virtually disappeared. My health anxiety went with those pretty much.
I suppose humans are great at suppressing the knowledge that we are all going to die some day otherwise life wouldn't be much fun. I think my experiences with death and illness of people close to me stopped me suppressing that and my stress and anxiety at the time made me relate it to myself. 
So relating all of that together, here is my advice:
CBT. I have an app called Quirk that really helps. It gets you into the habit of challenging those irrational thoughts. If apps aren't your thing, imagine you are in a courtroom being cross examined for your irrational thought, being pressed for the actual evidence etc. Your brain carves out a path and the more you think the same, the better and easier that path becomes for your brain. Challenge this path to start closing it off. 
Medication. I'd never taken antidepressants before and never wanted to but the truth is they just calmed my whole body down (after the side effects). My physical symptoms reduced greatly which was a game changer. Not saying they are right for everyone. Speak to your doctor of course. I'm definitely not a doctor.
Therapy. I was lucky enough to afford private therapy straight away. I would recommend it to anyone. They really get to the root cause. She helped me break the cycle by getting me to relate my symptoms to anxiety triggers and not other illnesses. 
Lifestyle changes. Exercise helps but fitness isn't for everyone. I'm a much more creative person so I forced myself to write some music and did things I enjoy. Whatever you do to enjoy yourself is better than sat worrying and googling symptoms.
Work out your triggers. If a certain situation results in a certain symptom, this realisation can help immensely. 
Dont rule out anxiety just because one of your many symptoms isn't on a list. We are all different. 
DO NOT Google symptoms. If doctor google was real he would have been struck off by now for getting everything wrong. 
Do not seek reassurance from statistics. If it says 1 in a million people your age will get this illness, you will still focus on the 1.
Do not seek confirmation of your self diagnosis from friends or family. This will only reinforce the faulty path your brain keeps sending signals down. Tell them to shut you down if you talk about health. 
Keep busy and productive while taking care of yourself. If a friend was going through a tough time you'd but them a gift etc right?. Do it for yourself.
Above all, if you have got this far you know its anxiety so take control and be proactive about fixing yourself. 
Hope this helps someone. Happy to talk to anyone going through this as it is horrible to go through.

I've been struggling with this specific issue for about 4 months now and I have no clue what to do. I feel like I'm not getting enough oxygen or can't take a deep breath. Sometimes it escalates to where I feel like I'm going to pass out. I keep going from doctor to doctor to ER to ER but they have no clue what is going on. I get that it is probably anxiety a lot but I'm not convinced at all. 
Today when I was dealing with this issue the only thing that would help was laying down on my stomach. That's the only thing that restores my breathing back to normal. I want to call my PCP but I've already told him and saw him about the issue sooooo many times and he said it was just anxiety. My appointment with the lung doctor was postponed for a couple months with everything going on so I'm not sure what to do.
Any suggestions? I really want to call my doctor and let him know about the issue again and fill him in on what helps to see if he has any suggestions.

Heart pounding strong, discomfort on left chest and sternum, etc, etc. I sleep well but once I wake up they hit me like a gun shot. It gets better and worse during the day. I keep thinking it's anxiety and try not to overthink ( but it's impossible).
Funny thing is that I had moments where I got distracted by something and my mind drove away from my body and.... MAGIC. All the symptoms completely disappeared. For example, yesterday, Christmas dinner, I was getting the heart pounding and and chest pain but when it came the moment to open the presents, without even knowing, my mind drove away and everything was gone, really really gone. Of course that once I realised what happened and that everything was gone my mind came back to my mind and everything hit me again.

So, I had a really bad pain on the left side of my abdomen the other day which I suspect was due to my period (check my post history). I had anxiety about it, but it quickly subsided by the end of the day. 
Currently, I have anxiety about developing COPD because I have asthma and my parents are renovating their home, so I've been exposed to a lot of dust. To be honest, I think I've been thinking a lot of my symptoms into existence. Like, I'm constantly breathing in and out to check my lung capacity and forcing myself to wheeze. I mean, I do have a dust allergy but I think I'm exaggerating it a bit. 
Anyways, lots of young people  have been dying from heart attacks lately. Lotte Van Der Zee (20), Felicite Tomlinson (18) etc, have recently passed away from heart attacks and they both seemed pretty fit I guess and my fat (I see myself as fat, but lots of people say I'm not) asthmatic ass is over here not working out, not drinking enough water or eating healthy sitting here like o.O. All of this combined with what I've been experiencing lately has my mind in a rut and I don't know how to cope.
I don't know what I'm doing here. I might be venting or asking for support?

537,2020-06-22T09:05:06+00:00,6ix-er,"Yet again, I was not dying even when my HA said I was.","Hi, everyone.  
This post has ended up pretty long, sorry!
I recently found this community, and it's comforting that I'm not alone in experiencing health anxiety. (Though it's sad to see that others are struggling so much with it, as well.)
I won't delve very far into how mine developed, but I've come to terms with the fact that I've experienced this for almost a decade. Over that decade, I have ""had"" cancer, parasites, HIV/AIDS, tetanus, and a plethora of other diseases and conditions. I find myself obsessing over the health of myself and my loved ones, and I tend to misinterpret sensations in my body that are likely normal and warp them into something terrifying. I can see this clearly now, but it's so incredibly scary during my ""episodes"". 
While this is horribly inconvenient and terrifying for me, it does provide some pretty great stories to tell-- like the time recently that I was convinced that I was dying (again) and ended up (surprise!)... not dying.
I was eating popcorn one afternoon and noticed a sudden pain in my gums, above my top teeth. I felt around some and came across a painful bump, near the front of my mouth. Of course, I ran to my bathroom, panicked, to look at this bump closer. It was raised and discolored-- a weird brownish-yellow color-- with the gums around it appearing irritated and red. 
I was distraught. Everyone tells you when you bring up health anxiety to not Google anything, but when you've already Googled so much before, you have a lot of information, symptoms, and diseases that you're able to go through in your head and panic about. So of course, this raised bump on the gums of a 21 year old who had never touched tobacco in their life was oral cancer.
I cried for days. I couldn't sleep, I was afraid to eat, as to irritate it more. I was constantly poking around my mouth and spending time in front of the mirror examining it. I Googled mortality rates and pictures and types of treatments I would have to undergo for it. I finally made an appointment with my dentist and waited for the worst.
And then one day, several days after I found this bump, I brushed my teeth. And after I was finished, I felt a sharpness in my mouth. I moved my hand up to feel what it was and was surprised to find a piece of a popcorn kernel.
I went back to the mirror and the ""cancer"" was gone. The raised ""discoloration"" was the brown coloring of a piece of a popcorn kernel that was pressed flat against my gums. 
And yet again, I was proven wrong. I was not dying. Especially not of something as out-there as that.
I guess my point here is that I've done this so many times. It's a cycle of seeing or feeling something in or on my body that I perceive as ""strange"", catastrophizing until I'm not able to function because I am so distraught and despondent, and then finally being ""proven wrong"" or the problem never coming to fruition. It's so hard to see in the moment, but it always ends up fine.
It was really nice to get this off my chest, and I hope that I can look back on this during my next, inevitable ""episode"" and see how silly I looked for sobbing over a popcorn kernel. I hope that if you're reading this and struggling, that you can laugh at me and maybe feel that your issue will turn out to be something trivial, too.",73,Create an account,https://old.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/hdot98/yet_again_i_was_not_dying_even_when_my_ha_said_i/,,,,,1,618,17.03,2.84,99,2.63,17.17,6.47,1.78,4.37,3.88,0.65,2.91,1.62,0.32,0.65,0,5.34,2.27,0.16,0.16,0,0.32,1.29,2.75,0.32,0,0,0,0.49,0,0,0.49,0.16,0,0,0,0.16,0,7.28,2.59,1.46,0,0,0.16,0.32,0.97,0.81,0.32,0.32,0.16,0,0.16,0,7.61,7.77,3.88,0.97,19.42,5.99,5.99,0,0.32,2.43,4.69,0

And as someone who has fully recovered, I've noticed besides many don't really know how recovery looks like. If you understand how recovery looks like, I believe you won't fall into anxiety cure gimmicks.
Because people don't really talk about how recovery looks like, even when you are making progress, its easy to self-sabotage and get discouraged during the recovery journey.
I wanted to give some steps on how recovery looks like. I recovered without any meds, or supplements btw. I focused on acceptance, exposure, and patience (I talk more about recovery below).
Everyone is different, and everyone is struggling with different aspects of anxiety (derealization, physical symptoms, panic attacks, obsessive ""what if"" thinking), but much of the core recovery are still the same across the board. I found my recovery (and those I've helped) follow this pattern. The recovery journey goes something like this:
​

If you struggle with panic attacks, this is the first thing to go away. Much of this is because you lose the fear of panic attacks. much of the fear is what keeps panic attacks alive for longer and more frequent. Once you lose the fear, it disappears pretty quick.
Anxiety still remains high, so you will still feel feelings of derealization, depersonalization, physical symptoms, what if thoughts. But the intensity decreases.  This is quite stubborn. As your nerves are sensitized, and your nerves won't calm down so easily (there are survival advantages to this). As anxiety decreases, the ""what if"" thinking also decreases. Physical symptoms lose intensity, but are still present.
You begin feeling glimpses of some freedom from anxiety in this step. Your fear now shifts from ""anxiety"" to ""what if the anxiety comes back?"" As you start getting better the glimpses of freedom get longer and longer
Getting hit with setback. There will be multiple triggers during recovery that will convince you that you haven't made any progress. You have. Keep moving forward. As you continue you journey, setbacks become less frequent and less intense.
Anxiety eventually disappears, but you don't know when it left you because after a while, you stop caring....you are too focused on living. Eventually physical symptoms, derealization, and everything disappear last (at least for me, and many of the people I help). Physical symptoms and derealization/DP lose intensity throughout the progress of recovery, so your confidence has grown during the entire duration of recovery.

I've created a video to really dive deep into the steps of recovery in the link below. I also talk about what I did to recover in way more depth in the link below.

I hope this inspires some hope and minimizes much of the confusion around recovery.

To top it off, I had a very frightening allergic reaction to something (withheld because I don’t want to trigger anyone’s anxiety) a few years ago.  I have been petrified to get my covid vaccine for months, to the point of complete distraction the past couple weeks.  I could do nothing anymore except doomscroll all day long.  My husband is fully vaccinated, and he’s the only person I’m really around.  Once the CDC said vaccinated people could still spread it, I’ve been afraid of being around my own spouse.  I knew I had to overcome this fear.
Today, after canceling several appointments and sitting outside a clinic and crying for an hour, I went inside and did it!  The nurse giving the shot was very sympathetic and sweet.  She never batted an eye at my tears, and was confident that nothing would happen, and on the off chance it did, she had the skill and tools to treat it and it wouldn’t be a big deal.  It was over before I even knew it had started, and I waited for 30 minutes.  She asked if I felt okay.  I did, and she told me I was welcome to sit with her as long as I liked.  I left and sat in a parking lot close to the hospital for awhile, then went home.  And I’m fine!  I am so happy I went through with it!  Not going to lie, I’m still just a bit anxious about the next few days, but nothing like I was for the past two weeks plus.

Seeing a therapist and getting professional help that'll actually benefit you will be far cheaper than the repeated emergency room visits.
I say this, but like so many of you, I have limited access to mental health care let alone mental health care that is affordable. So many of us (including myself) are uninsured, which only increases our anxiety. If you do have insurance though, take the time now to schedule an appointment with a licensed therapist/counselor/psychiatrist/etc. so you can learn how to manage your anxiety better.
Please don't cripple yourself with debt and make your situation worse if you have the insurance or if you can afford to see someone about your health anxiety. In the US, this is such an expensive mental health condition. I have my fair share of debt because of it already.

553,2018-07-25T04:00:56+00:00,Herman-Toothrot,"DVT / PE questions, reality check","Background - About 4 weeks ago I started having a dull pain in my left hamstring, a couple inches above the back of the knee.  It comes and goes, and gets better or worse with stretching.  It bothers me most when I’m sitting in a chair.  No other classic DVT symptoms like redness, swelling, intense pain, etc.  I showed my doctor during a routine physical exam and he said it seemed muscular and we didn’t need to bother with a clot test (he stretched both legs and both were tight, although the left was slightly tighter).
A couple days after that exam, I started getting a dull pain in my right/back rib area.  At first it was when I inhaled, but I noticed it also did it when I bent / stretched in certain ways.  I tried to ignore it as another muscular issue.  It hasn’t fully gone away (about two weeks later now), although I only feel it when moving certain ways.  And even then it’s a very minor ache - no classic PE symptoms like low oxygen, intense pain, shortness of breath, super fast pulse.
Anyway, I am trying to accept my original doctor’s diagnosis and move on with my life.
 But I can’t get the nagging DVT / PE thoughts out of my head.  Just looking for any support or advice.  I have flip-flopped between doing nothing, going for a second opinion, going to urgent care, or going to the ER (depending on how I feel that day).
Some random questions I’ve had during this adventure if anyone wants to comment ..

I know like every scary health issue there is some chance of having clots with only minor symptoms.  That is probably super rare though right?
Don’t clots progress quickly?  I have a feeling you wouldn’t have a clot for weeks and weeks with only minor symptoms (much less multiple clots).
Clots wouldn’t present themselves like muscular pains right?  Or be better / worse with stretching?  This is the one I wonder the most.
Rationally I’m pretty sure the answer is no, but I think this thought is the one that fuels my remaining anxiety about all this.

Anyway, I am working on de-stressing, meditating, exercising, and practicing what I learned in therapy (which includes trusting your doctor’s opinion the first time, if you have to go at all).

560,2020-02-04T01:08:40+00:00,Arayee20,I have not had a panic attack in three years. You CAN overcome this. (My story),"My anxiety began about 6 years ago from smoking a really potent strand of marijuana. I had my first panic attack while I was extremely high and thought I was going to die. Ever since that moment, I had a chain reaction of DAILY panic attacks for about 6 months. It was awful. I made my husband take me to the ER so many times, convinced I was dying.
​
I didn't understand why my body was doing this, and it created an extreme hypochondriac version of myself. I couldn't get off of Google. I had convinced myself I had MS, ALS, Parkinsons, brain tumors, cancer, blood disorders, liver conditions. You name it.  The thing about health anxiety is that when you read about symptoms and convince yourself you have symptoms, your brain plays a tricky game on you where it begins to CREATE those symptoms. Our brains are a VERY powerful thing. We still don't fully understand them, but I assure you our brains very much have the power to create symptoms from merely being scared of getting them. We have Lizard Brains. In all of our years of evolution, our brains STILL have the 'ol Fight or Flight system. We are creatures of incredibly complex thoughts. Our brains have one focused end goal it is always trying to achieve: survival. Because of this, our brains LOVE to worry, so we can create ways to survive. Although useful, this has turned into an extremely harmful thing when misused by hypochondriacs. We are constantly worrying, constantly trying to find ways to overcome hidden diseases that aren't even there.
Trust me, I have been there, and was there for several years. But I have not had a panic attack in three years, and when I do get bouts of anxiety, I can overcome it within 1-3 minutes. Aside from the usual suggestions on here which I fully endorse:
​

Exercise/walking.
Practice mindfulness/meditation
Supplement with magnesium or adaptogens like Ashwagandha.
GET OFF GOOGLE. Look, Google can be helpful. I still find myself using it to research symptoms, but I made myself a rule: Only Google a symptom if I have been enduring it for longer than 1-2 weeks. If I am still having issues, evaluate everything going on in my life. Is something I am doing causing this symptom? Stress? An injury? Am I not drinking enough water? Not getting enough sleep? What has my diet been like? If the symptom is effecting me severely for more than a week or two (which it hardly ever does because I will not Google it), then maybe I can see if it's something worth looking into, so I can find other options to help myself.
Gratitude Journal. Seriously. The more I focus on the good things I have going on in my life, and the more I practice telling people thank you, smelling the air, getting out in the sunshine, the less power anxiety has over me.
Nature. Being in nature is SO POWERFUL. I remember when I used to have anxiety attacks, if I went outside and walked around, my panic attack would melt away pretty quickly. There are all kinds of studies on the effects that nature has on us. Obviously this is hard during winter, but things I have found to combat that are: Filling my home with lots of plants and absorbing myself and being a good plant parent. Going to the conservatory.
Hugs. Seriously. Another thing that I find EXTREMELY RELAXING is hugging. There is also quite a lot of research on this as well.
Belly/diaphragm breathing.
Diet. I know this is always brought up, but man is it true. A lot of the foods we consume fuck with our blood sugar and impair our body's ability to cope with stress. 

THE BEST THING I DID FOR MY HEALTH ANXIETY WAS PURCHASING THE BOOK: Dare: The New Way to End Anxiety and Stop Panic Attacks. I do not have enough good things to say about this book. It changed my life. A huge component of this book is that HOW we react and BY REACTING to panic attacks is what keeps triggering them. Our fear of fear is what keeps triggering the constant fear. It has a simple solution, but takes time and patience, and can be very uncomfortable. It won't end getting feelings of anxiety, but it gives you the tools to let those feelings be small and fleeting, so you can easily move on. The book also comes with a link to his app, which has a lot of great audio content to get you through a panic attack when you are having one, which I used to use on the airplane.
​
When we feel anxiety coming on and we think, ""oh shit, not now, fuck, how do i get through this? I need to calm down, it's ok, it's ok!"" we are validating the anxiety, and confirming to ourselves that these feelings of anxiousness are something to be scared of, and something that we need to immediately be relieved of. We are training our brains to REACT to anxiety, instead of simply letting it be there, and then move on from it. My saving grace is picturing my anxiety as an adolescent version of myself. When anxiety pops up in my body, I immediately envision myself holding the hand of the ""child version"" of myself and thinking, ""Oh, hey! Wow, it is so nice to have you back! I am just going to the grocery store (or whatever activity you are doing at the moment), want to come along? Let's go together.  It will be so fun!"" Sometimes I envision my childlike version of myself as anxiety reincarnated, and then I take sympathy for this anxiety kid-version of myself and envision myself nurturing them. Throughout the panic/anxiety, I will think to myself, ""is this all you got? Because I actually forgot how much I love feeling dizzy and how much I love trembling. It actually makes me feel alive. Bring it on, I can take more!""
When you feel anxiety coming on, you have to start training your brain to WELCOME IT. This is uncomfortable at first. Who wants to be facing an oncoming panic attack and think, ""WOOHOO YOU'RE FINALLY HERE!"" but I swear to you, it works. It takes patience, consistency, and follow through, but this method seriously saved my life. When we start associating anxiety as a passing thought, something that is normal and boring, your brain will stop associating the feeling of anxiety as something to freak the fuck out over.
Even the first time I tried this, I was surprised with how fast the attack/anxiety passed. The more you begin to destruct how you react to anxiety, the quicker the anxiety attack will pass each time you have an episode. Anxiety is created by our brains/nervous system, and therefore we need to begin retraining our brains. When you start to panic over symptoms, think to yourself,  I have an extremely powerful, capable body, and I am MUCH STRONGER than I give myself credit for. I have overcome this anxiety before, and it will pass again. My body is tricking me. I am just going to continue doing XXX activity, and if these symptoms want to come along, then that is fine. They can be there. We can co-exist because I know it is just going to pass. But I am going to bring my attention to this thing I am doing now.""
I promise you, you can beat health anxiety by having the tools to not let it consume you. We will always be more sensitive to symptoms, but we can absolutely have the tools to not freak out over it, and ruin our days. Let me know if you have any questions.

I can't get over the feeling that I'm going to die soon and it's ruining my life.,"I've been struggling with a horrible anxiety flare-up for the past 7 weeks. I've made plenty of other posts if you want more details. Basically it's hit a new peak this past week. It started after my family left for a camping trip and I went to stay with some friends. I've had the ""I'm gonna die"" feeling and the other physical symptoms since this started but they began feeling worse. Eventually after hours of struggling on Saturday I had a panic attack much worse than my previous two. I actually thought I was going to die. I ended up passing out from hyperventilating and drinking too much water (leading to dangerously low salt levels) and having a seizure, ending up in the hospital. I'm still traumatized from the experience.
I was literally just with the doctor yesterday. He told me I was fine and not to worry about my heart. That should be enough to get rid of this feeling, but despite all the times I'm told that I'm not dying I still fucking feel like I'm dying and it gets worse every day. 
It's hard for me to describe. I get extremely dissociated and feel like I'm watching an artificial version of my life on a TV screen. And it's scary because my brain thinks I'm drifting away from reality. It's like my life is the show and my body and brain hate watching it so they're trying to turn it off. This combined with the physical symptoms (heart palpitations, numbness, chest tightness, trouble breathing, shakiness, nausea, popping ears, head pressure, diarrhea, lightheadedness, dizziness, left arm pain, blurred and sometimes distorted vision, intrusive thoughts, and overanalyzing every tiny fucking little feeling) creates this constant feeling that I am about to pass out or die.
I don't know what to do. It keeps getting worse every day. I'm not able to go to the store anymore. I can't get sleep because I'm scared of dying in my sleep. I'm tired of being told ""distract yourself by watching TV"" or ""go outside"" as if that will magically cure me. I can never do the breathing exercises or meditation because of how difficult it is for me to breathe steadily. I try my hardest to ignore it and move on to something else but it is just so crippling. And on top of this I convienientely caught a cold today so I get many more feelings to overanalyze.
I'm going to go to therapy soon once I find a good plan. The hospital took me off of Prozac but I did start Adavan recently. Sorry for the long rant. I'm just totally hopeless and scared.",73,Create an account,https://old.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/czuzwh/it_doesnt_matter_how_hard_i_try_i_cant_get_over/,,,,,1,468,31.07,1,97.83,1,15.1,7.48,1.07,5.98,2.78,0.21,2.56,1.5,0.21,0.21,0.43,3.85,1.71,0.21,0,0.21,0,1.28,1.5,0.21,0.21,0,0.21,0.43,0,0,0.43,1.28,0.85,0,0.21,0.21,0,9.83,4.7,1.71,0.64,0.85,0,0,0.43,1.5,0,0.21,1.92,0,0.43,0.21,6.62,5.34,7.69,2.99,17.95,6.62,3.42,0,0,5.56,2.35,0

569,2021-07-08T10:34:40+00:00,sahejoma,I got better and so can you! Tips from a fellow health anxiety survivor.,"I woke up today and realized I haven't had a major health anxiety flare up for at least half a year now. Maybe even longer. Two or three years ago I used to be very bad. I visited the doctors constantly finding new symptoms and changes in myself and trying to fix my anxiety, but I always felt like nothing worked and I was afraid that I'll never get better.
​
After I started CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy), I started getting better ever so slowly. It was a lot of work and at times it got worse, a lot worse, before it got better. I learned so much about myself and about ways to deal and live with my thoughts, emotions and ultimately anxiety.
​
Sometimes the unwanted thoughts and emotions come back. Sometimes I notice symptoms that trigger said feelings. But the thing is, I can deal with them. Two years ago I would've sent myself to a downwards spiral over things I can just brush off my head and deal with a clear mind today.
​
I'm not perfect and I know that I will have difficult times ahead of me some time in the future. In some way I know I will deal with these emotions and thoughts in some form or another for the rest of my life. The thing is, I trust myself that I can deal with it and make it through come whatever may. I'm stronger and more resilient than I was ever before.
​
I want to share some thoughts and tips with you that have helped me along the way. I'm not a medical or healthcare professional so don't take any of this as such advice. Just a friend giving advice.
​

Be prepared to put in a lot of work. Your mind won't heal itself. Even going to therapy won't magically fix you. The only thing that can fix you and your mind, is you. Therapy, counselling and other help is an invaluable tool to get you started, track and direct your progress, but in the end, you're accountible for your own wellbeing.
Look into getting into counselling or therapy. CBT and ACT (acceptance and commitment therapy) worked for me so I recommend those. If you can't find certified professional help, try to look in to other resources. I highly recommend Russ Harris's book The Happiness Trap for example.
On a side note to the previous one, be very mindful which sources you trust when looking into mental help advice. Self help is a huge market and there's a lot of misinformation and even malicious practices going around. This is why I highly recommend finding a certified professional.
Recognize your assurance seeking ""autopilots"" such as going to the doctors, googling symptoms, reading and posting about your symptoms on forums such as this one, asking for advice, checking your body for symptoms etc and stop doing them. It might help if you keep a diary for a while.
Learn how to distance yourself from your negative thoughts and emotions. Accept that it's a ""story"" that your mind is telling you. Not the truth. Acknowledge that in your mind: ""thanks for the story brain"", and move on. It may help if you imagine a funny character voicing your thoughts or emotions out (imagine Daffy Duck or Mr. Poopybutthole for example).
Try to help others and focus on the happiness of the people around you. It will in progress make you happier.
Try to find things to be grateful of every single day. It can be very simple and basic things. Even just ""I woke up today and I'm still breathing"" can be good enough for a bad day. Journaling can help a lot here too. Try to come up with at least three things every day that you're grateful of.
Find a person you can trust and who is able to listen to your concerns and talk to them about it. Just talking to someone and having them listen (don't ask for advice or reassurance! Just for a listener) helps you process your thoughts. Remember that this person is not a therapist, so remember to be a good friend and listen to their worries too!
Don't let your anxiety define you. You are more than your anxiety. You are a whole, awesome person with interests, dreams, achievements and so much more. Do things that you enjoy and try out new things. Try to live your life and be you as much as you can despite the fear and anxiety.
The ultimate step for recovery for me was the acceptance that there will never be certainty. Look into the philosophy of stoicism. There are things you can do to improve your health and your chances of being healthy and you should take those steps, but in the end, there's always the unknown. Learn to accept things that are out of your control.
When you notice new symptoms or things that worry you, unless it requires immediate attention (like acute care, emergency room type of care - you'll know when you need it), set it aside for a few days to a week and see if it passes. If not, re-evaluate your need of care. If your symptoms persist and the worry is not gone, it's ok to check it out with a professional. Don't google your symptoms or ask a friend.
Try to accept that your struggle with anxiety is a journey and there's a purpose for all this. I'm not a spiritual person by any mean, but I believe that my anxiety manifested for a reason and there are good outcomes to all of this. I am more compassionate and grateful towards others. I completely revamped my lifestyle and lost a lot of extra weight as a result. I learned a lot about myself and how to deal with difficult thoughts and emotions. I can help others with the same problems I've had. I'm a stronger and more resiliient person than I ever was. Try to find the good in the bad.

It often serves as a twisted escape mechanism so we can avoid facing difficult situations or decisions (after all, how can I worry about that stressful situation with school/work/family/friends/etc when I'm focused on self-diagnosing my mystery disease??). We often poke and prod and stare at ourselves in the mirror, searching for things to get anxious over, because we are (consciously or subconsciously) avoiding a bigger and more real situation.
Stay busy. Stay self-aware. Hold yourself accountable for addressing stressful situations in your life rather than burying your head in the sand and diverting your whole focus to your HA. Hold yourself accountable to stop googling, stop symptom searching, stop reassurance seeking. Hold yourself accountable to take care of yourself, because you arent going to be healthy if you dont put in the effort keep yourself healthy. 
My HA has been flaring up this week. I've been anxious about DVT. You know what else is going on in my life? Stress at work, stress from driving in snow/ice, a stressful job hunt, stressful upcoming exams. On top of all of that, I haven't been diligent about taking care of my mental health; I've slacked on my self-care hygiene routine of meditation and yoga. It's a recipe for a HA flare-up. And instead of continuing to hyperfocus on the tiny possibility of my slight leg pains being something catastrophic, I'm going to make the conscious decision to get back to focusing on myself and my future and the things that matter.

In addition, I have stopped Googling symptoms altogether for the last 9 days (which also has included visiting this subreddit), and have been making an effort to get out, socialize, and do things to get my brain away from the ruminating thoughts.

589,2020-02-21T22:13:38+00:00,awaythrow2125,I wonder what it’s like to live a “normal” life without health problems or anxiety.,"My life has been really fucking shitty for the past 9 months or so. I had really bad anxiety attacks then (I’ve had anxiety my entire life but these were the worst attacks I’ve ever had), and that ended up forming into depression after fearing I would always be horribly anxious everyday. Combine that with constantly going on and off with nicotine withdrawal, and that’s where I was at. While I still deal with depression and anxiety, I really thought I had been steadily improving. This month felt like the best month for me in a long long time, and I still think that’s true. I’ve been having problems with my throat that makes talking hard in the past year and I finally went to an ENT specialist for it, and started treatment. My depression felt like it was dying down and my health anxiety was put to ease after the ENT appointment confirmed I didn’t have cancer or anything.
And then today happened. I didn’t even know I had a doctors appointment today (check-up). I got there and like usual, everything seemed alright with me except for my heart rate and blood pressure. I’m 20 years old and have an anxiety attack practically every time I’m at the doctors office; my pulse was 139 while my BP was 141/99. I now have to monitor my blood pressure for the next month or so, get blood work done, and go back in a month. I was also up to 169 pounds today (was always around 150 during high school).
I’m just so fucking tired of this. I just turned 20. I’ve been an athlete all of my life except for the past year dealing with these issues, and I was starting to get back into daily exercise (still am). I’m a smart kid, have money in my bank account despite not working (full time student). I feel like I’ve been doing things the best I can and yet I always end up back here. I’m just so tired.
You know what’s even worse? I’m not stupid and I’m not heartless. I know damn well people have it worse than me and that makes me feel guilty complaining like this. A kid I knew in high school developed leukemia and lived through hell for two years before having to ask his own mother to let him go... and here I am... complaining about my problems.
Any encouraging words would be much appreciated. I’m just so exhausted... I’m 20 years old and I treated my body well for the first 18 years of my life, and while I haven’t treated it great in the past 2, most people I know my age treat theirs even worse and are fine. Now I’m sitting here with mental health problems and possible high blood pressure... at 20.

592,2019-06-03T21:56:44+00:00,tryna01,The hidden element in your anxiety recovery,"Anxiety sufferers tend to have a habit of wanting one thing. Certainty. Certainty that their symptoms aren’t malignant. When they get reassurances from their doctors, you know what they need? EVEN MORE CERTAINTY. It’s not their fault they’re dealing with this. One thing about anxiety many people don’t realize is that anxiety’s job is to heighten the possibility that the most devastating option is the most likely one.
If there is one phrase I hear constantly from people I help to help recover from anxiety/panic is “yeah but what if…” To be honest, it gets me frustrated. I also empathize because that phrase was part of my vocabulary when I dealt with anxiety and panic. It wasn’t till I found this hidden piece during my recovery, that I stopped using that phrase began making leaps and strides.
Now this hidden piece, once revealed, will make repulse many people on this post. Hang in there, I promise it’s not what you think.
The missing piece…was faith.
And no.
I’m not referring to the faith in a higher power, religious faith, etc. I mean faith in the most fundamental sense.  I mean faith in the ability to go into the unknown with the hope that everything will be okay.
Avoidance will only make your anxiety grow and become generalized (hence generalized anxiety). It's only when we go through the anxiety, does anxiety lose it's control and freedom becomes attainable.
Once I got the knowledge of the mechanics of anxiety and understood how anxiety tricks us into thinking we have some malignant disease. I made huge strides. But that itself was not enough. I needed to rely on the faith that everything was going to be okay in order for me to have the courage to face my anxiety and fully recover. I needed to rely on something when I started doing things that made me push my comfort zones.
For me, I had instilled faith on someone who had also suffered and recovered. He wasn’t a doctor, he wasn’t a therapist…but he understood how the mind worked. More importantly, this person knew how anxiety worked. He saw what I was suffering with, and helped me through full recovery. He made me do things that I didn’t feel confident in doing. But I had to instill some faith in the fact that things would get better. Otherwise I knew, for sure, I wouldn’t recover.
I’m saying, recognize in your recovery…there will be moments you will need to have some faith. Regardless of what your mind is telling you. Relying on someone who is objective is very helpful in moments like these. Especially someone who has recovered. Also realize that this reliance on someone isn’t permanent. Eventually this faith will be transferred into confidence in yourself. Which in terms will lead to a upward spiral to recovery eventually.
I don’t like posting nuanced posts like these because I feel like it can easily be misunderstood. But I couldn’t help post this info because it was just so valuable in my recovery and often so neglected.

I’ve been lurking on this sub for a long time but I’ve never posted anything. I just try to comment on posts to provide reassurance when I can, without asking for it in return. 
The past several months have been absolute hell for me. Symptoms on symptoms on symptoms.. some psychosomatic, some very real. Multiple visits to my PCP turned into a referral to an endocrinologist, which ended up being unsuccessful in finding answers. I had a parathyroid issue back in 2018 that was resolved with surgery, but ever since then, any and every symptom has me losing my mind thinking that it is all connected somehow. (It was a benign tumor on my parathyroid, causing hyperparathyroidism). Let me just go ahead and say that I am doing everything in my power to treat my anxiety. Medicine, GeneSight testing, weekly therapy, yoga, self help books, you name it. 
Anyways- I have been completely fixated on my head and eyes the past couple months. I have pretty bad eye strain/dry eye accompanied by tension and sinus headaches. I tried everything to get rid of them, but they weren’t budging at all, and only getting worse. Around Christmas, I accepted my “fate” and came to terms with the fact that I absolutely, 100%, have a brain tumor. You could NOT convince me otherwise. All day every day, my thoughts were consumed with it. I haven’t been able to function at work, socially, physically, emotionally, etc. I completely lost my appetite due to the anxiety of it all, which resulted in weight loss, which scared me even more. 
Fast forward to today- I got up and was nauseous as soon as I woke up. “Just another symptom of the brain tumor”, I thought. I pushed through and made it until about 10 am until I started getting super dizzy and nauseous at my desk. I could barely see straight or focus on anything. I couldn’t take it anymore and I got up and left (super out of character for me) and asked my mom to meet me at the emergency room. (I am terrified of hospitals. I have been one time in my life before today....emergency rooms terrify me). 
I got to the ER and only had to wait about 20 minutes to be seen. I told the doctor what was going on with my head and a few other things and she was incredibly kind and understanding. She immediately ordered a CT scan, loads of blood work, and a urinalysis. In my mind I was like “okay this is it. They are finally going to find it and I can start treatment and just get this show on the road.” I was terrified but I also felt this sense of relief knowing that I was about to have answers after all these months. 
A couple hours pass and I am a hot mess waiting for all my results. Finally, the doctor came in, looked at me with a smile and said “normal as can be!”
 ...... normal. Every single test, including the head CT, was completely normal. She walked through all my results with me. I cannot even explain the feeling that I experienced when she said that. Guess what else happened? The headache stopped. The nausea stopped. The dizziness stopped. It all just...stopped. My point is- health anxiety is REAL. The symptoms are so real. When you’re in the moment or going through a bad health anxiety flare up, there’s no way it can all just be “anxiety”... it HAS to be an underlying health issue, right? That’s what my mindset was. But I was so wrong... and I can venture to say that you are wrong about your scary symptoms too. If you have been checked out by a doctor and they assure you that you are healthy, BELIEVE THEM. They paid a ton of money and spent a lot of time to be able to correctly diagnose patients.

I explained that I was having pain and I let it get to my head. I also mentioned how I feel that I am a hypochondriac because of my health anxiety and how terrible it gets. She then laughed and said “oh so that’s why you’re here. I should have known you were one of those” and then asked “are your family members also convinced they’re dying all the time?” She then just told me to leave and not worry about the pain because it’s probably nothing.

602,2019-08-19T08:18:52+00:00,Kahlosa,Health Anxiety Victory!,"I’ve had health anxiety for maybe five years now, specifically heart-related. I haven’t had a panic attack in about a year, but I’m 36 weeks pregnant. Pregnancy and birth has always been a big fear of mine, and all the crazy new sensations have definitely been testing me so far. My biggest fear is getting pre-eclampsia (the major symptom being high blood pressure). 
I have major white coat and have had many a panic attacks from high blood pressure readings that included trips to the er and calling an ambulance (some of my lowest moments). I always knew if I got that high reading that it could trigger a panic attack, and also just thinking I could go into labor/be induced/emergency csection could trigger it as well.
Well tonight I got a high blood pressure reading while testing at home. I did as my doctor directed and laid in bed in the dark deep breathing for about 30 mins and tested again. It did not go down. So far I was only slightly anxious, but like normal human without anxiety anxious. I called the on-call doctor at my hospital and she told me to come in. Normally that call would be the biggest trigger for me. Someone confirming my fear. I’ve had calls like that before and bam full on panic attack. But it didn’t come. 
I did start my deep breathing and had to distract myself from thinking tonight could be the night as my hubby and I packed our hospital bags in the car and headed out. When we got to the hospital , I asked to sit there for a bit in the car. I turned on one of my meditation songs, deep breathed, and told myself that things might get scary but it will all be okay. 
After that I was pretty go-with-the-flow-y and managed to not let anxiety get to me. My blood pressure did go down and they sent me home to be on bed rest just in case. But I did it guys!!

Look for brain tumor symptoms
Notice some of them fits you (psychological-related ones like mood swings, or being unable to laugh or cry properly)
Convince yourself you have a brain tumor
Terror your family about such thing
They tell you numerous times you are okay
Don't believe them for some reason
Go to your GP
Say about your psychological problems
The doctor gives you magnesium and some herbal sleeping pills, because the doctor thinks it may be due to stress
Feel reassured for a short while
Start thinking about brain tumor again
Join r/HealthAnxiety and this community's Discord
Talk about your problems
They say you that you don't have a brain tumor
Write on r/AskDocs with details and stuff
Someone says you that you don't have a brain tumor
Finally, decide go to GP once again (another one, because your GP doesn't longer work in your place of living)
Describe the symptoms again
She suspects a mental illness
GP gives you a referral to a psychiatrist
""Okay, so no brain tumor. It's a mental illness."" - you think
Go back home
After like 2 hours, start thinking about having a brain tumor again. Be close to schizing out

605,2018-09-29T18:09:40+00:00,sugardoodl,"Odd head tingling, temple pressure, numbness, feels like I'm going crazy..","Last year I was put on Wellbutrin for anxiety and depression which in the end of the week caused my very first panic attack, I had an intense brain zap/head tingle fit that scared me enough to think I was actually going to die right there in my room. All of that has made me very afraid of my health and that's where I started having more panic attacks, the typical heart scares and dozens of EKG's and tests. 
What's been bothering me the most in the past month is neurological damage, waking up smelling the same smell of burnt plastic, it wouldn't bother me so much at first until it lasted an hour, followed by a migraine and that elastic around the head feeling pressure headaches. 
Surprisingly, I don't feel like the migraines are as debilitating as this other sensation that's been pretty much daily since last month.. The best way I can describe it is like having pins and needles behind your scalp, running through the top of my head, and behind my eyes, it makes me feel as if my eyes are vibrating and they physically aren't, but it's driving me crazy, with the numbness in my fingers and the fear of MS or any other more common nerve damage disease. 
More important things to note is I have an under active thyroid, my last tests came out normal and I take 125mg of euthyrox every day. I'm also getting a brain scan on the 16th next month and it's scaring me to think that all these physical feelings might be something more. 
I think it's hard because I don't know anyone who's just anxious and has felt these sensations that I describe, and every day I feel like it's getting worse and I feel insane, helpless, alone.. I don't want to go to the doctors anymore just to ignore what I'm feeling, since my appointment yesterday they just threw some Sertraline my way, and I really just hope all of this is anxiety.",69,Create an account,https://old.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/9jz6ar/odd_head_tingling_temple_pressure_numbness_feels/,,,,,1,349,26.29,2.19,96.84,1,34.9,6.59,0.57,5.16,5.16,0.29,4.01,3.44,0,0.29,0,3.72,1.72,0,0.29,0,0,0.57,2.01,0,0,0.29,0,0,0,0,0,1.43,0,0.29,0.86,0,0.29,10.03,5.44,1.15,0,1.72,0,0,0,0.29,0,0.57,0.86,0,0.29,0,6.3,4.01,8.6,1.43,14.61,3.72,5.73,0,0,4.87,0.29,0
606,2022-01-05T23:10:56+00:00,mathrsar,How to overcome fear of ALS?,"To me, ALS is the most terrifying disease in all of medicine that is relatively well known to the general public due to it being certain death with nothing anyone can do and being a particularly cruel way to die in how it locks you into your own body while you're fully aware before putting you out of your misery.  And things don't seem like they'll change anytime soon despite scientists' efforts.  I've always assumed ALS was very rare but with the publicity it's received and Wikipedia describing it as the the third most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, I've come to believe that it's more common than I thought.
As such, I constantly scan my body for symptoms of ALS and often convince myself that I have them and will die soon.  I haven't found any clinical weakness, which is good, but the problem is that the sites I read say things like hyperreflexia, the Hoffman sign and muscle fasciculations are associated with anxiety as well (which I obviously have).  It seems like a vicious  cycle where the more I worry about ALS, the more ""symptoms"" of it I have and the more I worry.  I should add that I'm in my 20s.  The internet makes it seem like just about any symptom affecting movement or the muscles (twitching, cramping, stiffness, weakness etc) not attributable to an obvious acute cause equals ALS, MS, brain cancer or some other serious neurological condition.  
I also ended up on ALS forums reading too much about people's experiences with ALS.  I was particularly struck by cases of young people near my own age or in their 30s getting the disease (or seriously thinking they have it to the point of ending up in a neurologist's office) even though a study said that only 10% of ALS patients were under 45 at diagnosis.  Additionally, there are many people on forums who think they have ALS despite normal EMGs and exams from doctors.  For example, this patient thinks their neurologist doesn't understand ALS and this patient still finds reasons to think they might have ALS despite being deemed not to by two neuromuscular specialists and 3 EMGs.  Can these people really be right and their doctors wrong?  I found out that benign fasciculation syndrome, or BFS, can mimick early ALS but I read someone in a forum saying that their doctor had seen more ALS than BFS making it seem like BFS is actually less common than the real thing while others sites say that BFS is common.  I've also read that ALS can present as just twitches and cramps for a while before weakness sets in while other sources say that weakness always accompanies or precedes twitching.  Finally, I've read multiple posts from patients who say they got a normal EMG at first before later being diagnosed with you-know-what.  I've gotten to the point where I've become hyper aware of my body and think that every little twitch of a muscle and every little ache is ALS.  I don't even have the level of twitching described on /r/bfs and would have thought nothing of it in the past.  I first experienced this fear in my teens before it when into remission for some years.  Back then, I was just afraid of getting ALS, now it's a more classic hypochondria.

My rational brain is trying to tell me it doesn’t make sense that suddenly all of these symptoms show up at once, especially considering they seem to ebb and flow with my anxiety levels.

613,2019-02-26T16:20:58+00:00,Justin_Wesley,Dealing with health anxiety for years... and how Im learning to move on from it,"Im no expert and I know everyone is different but I’ve come a long way with my health anxiety and wanted to share a little of what I learned.
(On mobile, excuse format and typos)
I once read something along the lines of “our brain believes everything we tell it, so if we start filling it with doubt and anxiety, we create a world that is simply not true” 
A year ago and I was telling myself every little symptom meant imminent death, I worried about brain cancer, breast cancer, blood cloths, etc etc etc. 
Im still in the process of completely desensitize myself from the most minimal sensations and Im still trying to learn how to really understand what my body is trying to tell me, this is kind of how I learned to deal with it (again, I know not everyone is the same but hopefully this will be useful for someone) 

If I can distract myself from the sensation or discomfort then its anxiety, I call them “sensations” because any little thing I feel I wanna convince myself is pain even if its not. I try to ignore it if thats the case. My doctor always told me small sensations or symptoms are not a sign of anything serious.
If its interrupting your day to day then take something for your symptom and try to move on, (eg., you have a sore throat then get something specifically for that) 
If over the counter meds don’t do it and its well over a week or so then I’ll call my Doctor explain whats going on and see if I can come in for some answers and peace of mind. 

If you have multiple terrible symptoms then of course go check with your doctor asap. But the main thing is, breathe friend. Don’t freak out immediately, don’t google about it, try to accept the thought and the sensations as exactly that, thoughts and sensations and nothing more, they’re not a sign of anything. 
You won’t heal your mind in a day but in time things will get better.
Ironically, life is not guaranteed for anybody no matter what, but looking for symptoms constantly means you’re wasting something you want to hold on to so desperately.

If you search something with a trigger word in it — e.g. tumor, cancer, als — you'll get an overlay suggesting you come here to deal with the anxiety instead. You're still the one who ultimately has to resist searching, but it's helped me be more mindful of the damage I'm potentially about to do.

615,2018-06-22T00:23:36+00:00,ThouArtNaught,This is me.,"You can't do anything. Your brain is releasing stress hormones which guarantees fear and dread. Your mind is terrified of a threat that it cannot adequately identity, and so the terror is amplified. 
This what my anxiety looks like: 
Brief chest and arm sensation occurs
You immediately connect the dots
""This is definitely cardiac.""
Cortisol release
""Holy shit I'm feeling strange. The heart attack is getting worse. My chest is getting a bit tight.""
Cortisol continues to create dread, physical symptoms, and impending doom
""Fuck I'm going to die alone. Why did I eat so many steaks. I did this to myself.I'm not even that fat though""
Cortisol continues to be the only source of symptoms
""I must do something. I'll dial 911 and not hit send until I inevitably begin collapsing. I hope they'll understand my gibberish and track me with GPS or some shit""
Cortisol keeps poking you with a fork
""What if I google every conscious sensation I feel.""
Top google results say angina and heart attack. Third is anxiety. Fourth is stroke.
""Okay wtf. Now I'm feeling a headache. My right arm feels weak.""
A little more cortisol is released. You sit shaking in complete dread for the longest 30 minutes of your life.
""Okay there was anxiety involved, but I'm absolutely sure there was some cardiac stuff. I should still get checked""
Definitely no cardiac stuff involved, only cortisol
""Fuck my life, why must I be so close to death at 25. I must accept my fate now. I will not be a little bitch. Come for me reaper, you piece of shit!""
Anxiety inevitably dimishes after an hour. You feel like a healthy retard but subconsciously reinforced your hypochondria yet again.
""I'll deal with my dormant terminal illness tommorow. I'm hungry.""

I (22F) went to my OBGYN today for a checkup after switching birth control pills 3 months ago because of high blood pressure and, of course, I get extremely anxious every time I have to get it taken. I can’t pinpoint why I’m scared of it exactly, but it’s been high every time I’ve gone to the doctor for the past couple of years (around when my health anxiety started) and I think that’s made me really anxious about it, on top of my anxiety of even setting foot in the doctors office to begin with.
So of course it was VERY high today (160 over 103), and I began freaking out and crying as soon as I was taken back (I was already holding back tears to begin with). My doctor came in a little confused, but talked to me and just asked that I take my BP at the grocery store or pharmacy a couple of times within the next few weeks and send her the results. 
I’m embarrassed for crying of course, but I’m also embarrassed for not being able to calm down when getting my BP taken. My heart races every single time and I try my best to breathe slowly, but it seems like that only makes it worse. It makes me feel like a child and that the nurses think of me as one too. I’m scared because I don’t want high blood pressure (as nobody does). I never thought that somebody my age would deal with it, and I’m absolutely dreading having to get it taken again. 
I don’t really know what to do. My doctor obviously recommended therapy which I’ve been considering, but I’m worried about the cost and having to tell my family that I want to go. I’m also scared that my BP will be high again when I go get it done myself, and that I’ll just have to see more doctors where I might get diagnosed with something (which is my worst fear).

For 6 months I’ve been unable to rest, sure that I’d be dying soon (silly I know). After an EKG, chest X-ray, several blood tests, and countless doctors visits, I’m finally positive that I’m healthy. Here are the symptoms I’ve been feeling that were 100% caused by my health-anxiety:
1. Awful chest pain. It ranged from dull to sharp and I felt it all day, everyday (even when I was calm). Occasionally it spreads to my back.
2. Shortness of breath. Even standing up would leave me winded. Feels like a fist around your chest.
3. Back, shoulder, neck, and arm discomfort. This one had me thinking I was having a heart attack lol. Strange tension in these areas.
4. Constant headaches. Some minor, some unbearable.
5. Fatigue and weakness. I’m exhausted even if I’m on the couch in the middle of the day after a full night of rest. My arms and legs feel particularly weak and heavy.
6. Brain fog and dizziness. Can explain it no other way than feeling high all the time. My vision seems to blur often.
7. Simply feeling sick. I constantly feel like I have a cold or a fever. When I check however, my temperature is normal.
8. Heart palpitations (SUPER common). Especially at night. Heart would randomly start beating in my ears. Sometimes this seemed painful. 
There are a few more, but these are the “symptoms” that brought me most stress. While I still recommend seeing a doctor to ease your mind, I can promise you that you are fine.

My anxiety and depression (and especially health anxiety) tends to occur as rumination. I just wanted to share that what helped me more than anything else was Michael J Greenberg's articles on OCD (you can find them for free online). I couldn't believe how heard I felt, and I don't even have OCD, just a TON of rumination and googling, as I'm sure many of us have! 
He talks about how to stop ruminating and why it's not useful. I will admit, the first few times I tried his method I couldn't do it and I felt like it would never work, but after trying it about 10 times I finally had a breakthrough and I had one time where I managed to stop worrying, I felt better, and it came back. But by that time I was addicted and realized that I didn't HAVE to ruminate, it didn't make my symptoms worse to not do it.

and ironically, i cope in some of the unhealthiest ways imaginable. i drink excessively, smoke cigarettes... etc. 
point being: stabbing pain on the left side of my chest combined with dehydration / hangover sent me into an unbearable panic attack this morning. i had a good friend drive me to the er, and hes witnessed a plethora of my panic attacks before, where all I'm able to do is hold his hand and cry and ask a million times if I'll die today or what these feelings are, even though i know that he doesn't have the answers. well, after getting a clean bill of health from the er, and sobbing hysterically in front of doctors who have actual sick patients to care for in a pandemic, i feel beyond ashamed and like a burden and sure that i seem crazy and will forever seem crazy to everyone, even though my friend who sees all of the panic promised me it's nothing to be ashamed of (angel fr)

I started thinking in a way that made me feel incredibly grateful for my birth and existence. It's a miracle that I even exist, that I was born into this world, that I got the chance to experience any of this, whether that be pain and struggle or happiness and success. I got to experience it all, and it's a miracle that I'm able to have this experience and appreciate it.
Thinking like this made me realize how many fulfilling things and emotions I've experienced, love, excitement, sadness, guilt, regret, happiness, anticipation, nervousness, and anxiety. I'm incredibly happy that I got the chance to experience all of this at all, to be alive.
And one day it'll all end, like all life on this earth does. But I shouldn't fear it because all good things end, that's why they're good afterall. A good tv show is one wraps up when it's told everything it wants to, not something that stretches out aimlessly.
Even if I end up dying without accomplishing everything I want to, I'm glad I lived for many things, I'm glad to be alive for the new chapter of one of my favorite manga that's coming out today, I'm glad to be able to have played many video games that brought me joy, I'm glad to have spent time with and gotten to know the friends I've had over the years, even with the relationships that didn't end as well, and I'm glad to have known my parents, despite how flawed they are despite how rocky are relationship could've been.
I'm grateful that I got the chance to experience everything I did, and when I think of the end, I shouldn't be sad that everything is gonna end, I should be glad that I got to exist and experience every little sensation, feeling and emotion I did.

Three questions to ask.,"Many months ago, I was going through a particularly bad bout of anxiety that eventually culminated in some physical sensations. I worried daily, hourly, over every ache, twinge, and tingle. I had chest pain, arm and leg tingles, headaches, etc. My worries jumped from this to that over what it could mean. 
A post on here really resonated with me and helped me get over the last hurdle to being free of HA (finally!). It was a doctor's advice - something along the lines of: is it persistant? Is it worsening? Is it severe? 
I had multiple tests done (blood tests, x-ray, samples, ultrasounds), that seemingly cleared me of anything serious. But still wasn't convinced. These simple questions helped me work through my HA, sifting through the symptoms that were most likely anxiety related:

Was it persistant? No, my symptoms often disappeared when I was with family, friends, or distracted doing something I enjoyed (music, art, exercise, etc). Only reappeared when I remembered them.
Was it worsening? No, it would tend to come and go, and/or change into something else.
Was it severe? No, it was generally mild and nothing that could stop me from doing daily tasks.

Before calling a doctor, sit with those questions for a day or two, or even a week or two and see what happens. Personally, when armed with these questions and healthy distractions, nearly everything disappeared with time.
I hope this helps someone like it did for me!

Then I was like “reddit can distract me”, but after looking at random things health was still on my mind, so I went searching to see if there was anything that might help. 
And then I found this sub. 
For once I don’t feel so alone. You’re telling me other people have had regular scares about blood clots/heart attacks/brain tumors? 
My anxiety has been through the roof for 5-ish months, I keep cycling through different aches and pains and when something pops up I’m certain that it’s over for me. Why not? If anybody was going to die from a brain bleed at 22 why not me? I’ve actually memorized the signs of a stroke because yanno, why not throw that into the mix? 
My fiancé tries to calm me, he really does, but he’s fit as a fiddle and if he has any weird pain he doesn’t dwell on it an then it’s out of his mind. 
Anyway I just wanted to say thanks. I’ve been feeling so alone, and even now I’ve got pinching/burning pains all in my legs, but I know—I KNOW—I’m okay. I’ve got to get a grip, and this sub has helped in a way that no one, not even the many doctors I’ve seen have.

The one I don't want anyone else to see because the shit I was going through was embarrassing and I wanted nobody (except for internet strangers) to know.
I stopped getting on this account when I started feeling normal, better. From time to time I thought ""I need to let them know how I'm doing. They need to know there is hope."" But I'll be honest, I was anxious about the symptoms returning, about jinxing myself by writing a post.
Anyway, It's been nearly 7 months ago since I was at my lowest point with HA. My life was falling apart. I was thinking about dropping out of my graduate degree program, didn't think I could continue to work, and spent hours each day just hiding in my bed from the rest of the world while my wife (a champion) took care of the house and our two small children.
I went to therapy (this is a must), I read self-help books, I meditated multiple times per day, I exercised daily, and I also finally found a medication that seemed to work for me. I also confided in two close friends of mine (one that I work with) about the problems I was having so that I knew I had a safety net when I was out of the house (and vulnerable).
It took a lot of work, and it was not a quick transition. I still have days where I feel ""off"" or have a strange new symptom; but I know longer dwell on these fleeting feelings or allow them to snowball me into a panic attack or week (or month) long binge of internet searches that never left me satisfied anyway.
If you are struggling or want to talk to someone who has beat this monster known as Health Anxiety, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I still have to be mindful of where I was and hopeful for where I am going; and each day bring new challenges.

641,2019-11-07T02:09:09+00:00,dumb_user_name,For those of you with Lymphoma concerns,"Lymphoma was my most recent obsession until I went and saw my doctor today. He gave me some good advice/facts that I thought I would share with those of y’all who are mentally diagnosing yourselves with lymphoma like I was for the past 6 weeks: 
1) Sometimes you can have a lymph node that just DOESN’T go down in size after an illness. About 6 months ago, I got a nasty cold virus that caused a node in my neck to swell like crazy. It went down afterwards, but not to a small, undetectable size like the one on the other side of my neck. This node has been the driving force behind my anxiety for a while now, so hearing this really helped. He said it would probably just remain that size and there’s nothing to be concerned about. It did its job by helping fight the virus, and then got as small as it could afterwards. No big deal.
2) He told me it’s okay when my lymph nodes swell for no reason—as long as they get smaller, there’s no reason for concern. A huge trigger for me is finding a randomly swollen one when I KNOW I feel fine, but now I know it’s just my body working as it’s supposed to. It’s fighting something, and maybe it will do a good enough job that I’ll never even feel sick! Apparently, the real concern comes when one swells, and swells, and continues to swell for weeks with no decrease in size (and by “real concern”, he just meant that they’d wanna do imaging. It could still have other explanations that don’t lead straight to lymphoma).
3) Your preauricular nodes can swell due to acne flare ups! Who knew? (I’m assuming other nodes can swell for this reason, but he specifically mentioned these)
Again, this is just what MY doctor shared with me, so obviously go see yours if you’re feeling sick/bothered by a lymph node. 
I personally come to this sub to calm my fears and learn more about why I’m experiencing certain symptoms, so hopefully what I learned today can help calm someone who’s freaking out and 100% convinced they’re dying of Lymphoma.

644,2019-04-11T17:08:17+00:00,tourist25,Had a scan today - convinced the results would be bad. They weren’t.,"I had a hard, fixed, immoveable lump on my lower back on the right hand side along my waist line. The doctor felt it and said she ‘wasn’t too concerned’ but that she wanted me to have an ultrasound.
Cue panic.
I googled feverishly whenever I got the chance. Before sleep, on the toilet, during lunch.
My symptoms didn’t seem to fit any of the good scenarios. A good scenario would be a lipoma, which is a benign gathering of fat cells that form a lump. But my lump felt hard - not soft. It felt attached to bone. It felt immovable, not like a lipoma should. Basically, my brain (and google) had convinced me that this was bad news. Bone cancer maybe. What’s the survival rate on that?
Went in for the scan this morning. Got lubed up. Texted a few close friends my final thoughts on a life well lived. (I'm 31) 
I had images of good and bad ultrasound pictures burned into my memory from my constant googling. I mean, I was practically a doctor by now. ‘Move out of the way nurse, for I have studied many's a google image and shall not only reveal the issue here, but also provide an exact estimation of the days I have left upon the earth’
‘Yeah, it’s a lipoma.’ was her response. Was she sure? The lube is just warming up nurse, have another look, as I’ve told my wife this is minimum stage three cancer which may have spread from my as yet undiagnosed lung cancer.
Lipoma. Not cancer. Not anything untoward. A collection of fatty cells and nothing more. I was convinced it was cancer.
I wonder was there anything else they could have scanned me for while I was in there. I want a chest x-ray. Must get on that.",67,Create an account,https://old.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/bc2eac/had_a_scan_today_convinced_the_results_would_be/,,,,,1,316,38.96,1.44,83.19,20.23,9.88,2.85,1.27,1.27,2.53,0.95,1.27,0.32,0,0,0,6.33,2.85,0,0,0,0,1.58,3.16,0.32,0.32,1.58,0,1.27,0,0,1.27,0.95,0,0,0.95,0,0,7.59,4.43,2.53,0,0,0,0,0.63,0,0.32,0.63,1.58,0,0,0,3.48,9.49,2.85,0.63,20.89,9.49,4.11,0.63,0,3.48,3.16,0

The first incident being when I was 14: I thought I'd become the victim of a crime. Then in college I thought it was diabetes, glaucoma, and breast cancer. After moving on from that I thought I'd become a serial killer's victim. Since then I've thought I had a couple other diseases and even Ebola. 
In December brain fog hit me and I've been self-diagnosing with anything and everything. Right now (in my head) I'm allergic to everything under the sun including the sun. 
The point I'm getting at is, if there's a pattern or history of health anxiety or general feelings of unsafety, it's important to recognize that. It might help you snap out of your bout of health anxiety. ""But it's real this time!"" It was real then too. You weren't carefree and easygoing when out of the blue you started experiencing symptoms. You've always been hypersensitive to sensations, anxious, and catastrophic in your thinking. 
Another thing to note: If something is seriously wrong with you, it gets worse and worse over time. Symptoms don't switch out and transform every couple days or weeks. You'd consistently experience the same symptom getting worse. The brain fog I experience has improved some with changes in diet, so I've acknowledged that. 
Normally I run around like a chicken with its head cut off on this sub but I had a moment of clarity I thought I'd share.

​
If you look at my posts going back, i was freaking about a whole host of symptoms 5-6 months ago. While i am not totally free of all of the symptoms I am in a much better state than before and I always used to think that when i get better I'll write about it.  So this is my attempt to give something back.
​
Here is the list of symptoms I had

Twitching (still have it sometimes)
Internal shaking - the feeling that your whole body is shaking when you wake up
waking up with my heart racing
hand tremors
body pain
muscle tightness
Shaky vision
Not able to sleep through the night ( I used to wake up every 2-3 hours)
Fast heart rate even by going for a short walk
a weird feeling of my pulse everywhere
pin pricks
cold spots (sometimes still get it when i am stressed)
tingling
a warm flush feeling at times
Feeling of water dripping down on my legs and so on

This is the list i remember off hand and i am sure if i think even more I'll remember the other symptoms. I also went through the entire gamut of ranging from MS to ALS and was freaking out. I visited a number of doctors and all the blood tests and physicals came back normal. I was really scared and frustrated and frequented this forum a lot.
​
My google searching took me a site aboutbfs where all the symptoms seemed to match it. But even reading through the forums i found no joy since it seemed like people suffered from ""BFS""  for the rest of their life and I didnt want that. That said, I found some success stories which all raised an emphasis that if you reduce your stress over  a period of time, your symptoms will abate and eventually go away. Unwilling to suffer from these symptoms all the time, i took the following steps which have helped me a lot

I totally stopped Googling my symptoms - I really cant emphasise this enough. Stop reading up on your symptoms
Stop going to medical forums. You will always find something which matches to your symptoms and you will wonder if you are that unique case
Stay away from forums like aboutbfs and the facebook groups about it. Even though BFS is benign, lot of people get caught up in it and stress out even more and they never recover
Meditate - Honestly, i can't stress this enough, this has helped me so much. There are several meditation options available such Headspace (app with a subscription), Insight timer (my favorite meditation app and its free !!) and the honest guys on youtube. Honestly find something that works for you and do it.
Get a hobby:  I took up learning spanish since i always wanted to learn a new language and took up digital painting. I also started working on a blog post called living in the united states (feel free to visit it but no pressure)
Seriously stop self testing yourself or strength testing. I know this can be hard and i tend to do it sometimes but by constantly reassuring yourself you are just maintaining the worry cycle.
Smile :) and laugh. Watch some good comedy shows. Do something with someone that makes you laugh.
A website which was of great help to me was the anxietycentre website. I was initially suspicious that it was a scam but after i took the plunge and signed up for their 6 month membership, i found a lot of information which taught me how anxiety and stress can cause all the crazy symptoms we worry about. It also taught me some valuable tools in how I can beat my stress and calm my nervous system down. They do offer counselling but I never took it. (Important: I have no affiliation with this website, but it was super instrumental in setting me on the path of recovery)
Trust your doctors - I know this is hard but honestly your 2 months of googling doesn't make you an expert. If you need to get a second or third opinion do it but stop right there. Don't go and get 20 opinions.
Give it time - When your nervous system is hyperstimulated so much that you are getting all these weird symptoms, its going to take time to relax it. Don't expect success in 2 days, 2 weeks or 2 months..think more like 6 months - for example, i am still recovering but i am getting there. Also our normal tendency is to go back to our bad habits of worrying and stressing our bodies out once our symptoms abate which is what we need to avoid. So doing the steps you need to take to calm your nervous system is a long term process. Also as time goes by, you will realize you are just fine :)

All the best. I know if i can beat this, you can too.

I'm 19, 6'0, and around 200lbs. since around early November I've been battling the most severe bout of anxiety in my entire life. It first started when I found a bit of blood in my stool after constipation and a lot of pain, which I now know it was most definitely a tear. Not knowing that at the time, I made the horrible horrible mistake of googling what it could mean. I got fixated on the possibility it could be CC, and I spoke to everyone in the family about it and got about the same answer; it's nothing, no family history, don't worry about it. So I didn't, for a time.
Nothing happened through mid December, but around December 15 or so, I started having some stomach pain right behind my belly button, a dullish pain and a feeling of being bloated when the pain stopped. Naturally, I connected the prior event and this one as symptoms of CC, and the wonderfully vague symptom of ""abdominal discomfort"" I had remembered from when I googled it. I got worried that I might have it, or have to get a colonoscopy to confirm if I don't. 
This pain continued until right at Christmas, when I stopped taking my ADHD medication. During the week where I stopped taking it, I had nothing at all. No pain, everything normal. When vacation ends and I start taking my medicine again, the pain returns. 
I finally gave in and had an appointment with my doctor about it, and he said it was just anxiety and nothing to worry about, as CC wouldn't just go away, it would be constant. The pain went away for a few days and then came back, and it's been back now since about January 10th, along with this slight feeling of bloat. I should probably note that all my bowel movements have been completely normal since, aside from me not knowing that tomato shows up in the stool as red and almost having a heart attack. 
I'm sorry that this is a very long ramble, I've just honestly had not much of anyone to talk/vent to about this. I keep telling myself ""it's nothing, stop being stupid"" but I start thinking of the horror stories of 20 year olds getting CC and I get right back into the loop.

It became clear to me how badly I needed to change my life when I was celebrating my grandpa's birthday yesterday and I was barely able to enjoy any of it because I was constantly worrying about symptoms. My anxiety has almost completely taken every part of my life now, and I have finally had enough. I can't play games anymore, can't work out, can't masturbate and I am barely able to have a social life.
2020 has already become the worst year ever for me, so at this point, I don't even care about trying to fix it, I just want to make sure this will be the last year I am driven by my anxiety.
Yesterday I finally started working out again, doing stretches and trying to expose myself to things that make me anxious. It's gonna be a hard battle, but I really recommend everyone starting right now. The sooner you start fighting the sooner you will be able to live a normal life you can enjoy.

UPDATE 1: Just got done with my first ""real"" workout in like 7 months and I have decided to work out at home the first few days just to get comfortable and mainly focus on cardiovascular exercises. I started by jogging in place for 10 minutes then I did 15 pushups and did another 10 minutes of jogging. Got a little headache and just to be sure after finishing I checked if its was hypertension just in case but my blood pressure was normal. Tbh the worst part about working out was when I stopped doing the exercise since I became hyper-aware of my breathing.

There’s probably lots of you who go for runs/walks when you’re anxious, including myself, and most of the time it works wonders. Other than a distraction, the scenery and just moving your body, there’s actually some psychology behind why it’s so helpful. As everyone knows our perceived threat triggers our flight or fight response trying to keep us protected, which then causes all the terrible symptoms and feelings anxiety comes along with. By walking or running, it tricks our brain into thinking that we are running away from the perceived threat, and eases the anxiety. So if you can, go for a walk!

1 year ago, I was crying in the bathroom at my apartment convinced I had one of many fatal, undiagnosed illnesses.
.5 years ago, I felt like I had a headache and a stiff neck for an entire month that never went away. I saw many doctors who I didn't think understood what was wrong with me.
Now, it's been half a year since I've seen a doctor. It's been 4 months since I've had a panic attack. I control those feelings now. I feel empowered that I am able to let my anxiety dissipate when it starts showing up. I'm able to push myself hard with excersize again and not be afraid of feeling my heart beat intensely.
I wasn't sure about how life would progress, but now I know that it gets better. I know a lot of people here are experiencing a very difficult time with their lives. But I wanted to let you know it gets better. On your good days, do as much as you can to work on improving yourself. On your bad days, do what you need to get through it. It didn't happen fast, but bits of progress pieced themselves together over time, and life today is unimaginably better from what it had been for almost the last 2 years living with hypochondria.

Seen constant urge to pee as a common symptom for people with anxiety and no answer for why after various tests.
So for a week I had the constant urge to urinate. Although it didn't effect me while sleeping. Had urine test for a UTI come back clear. In the UK the health system is frustrating slow so I thought I'd try to work out what was wrong with me myself. 
Long story short - guessed it was muscular as sleeping was fine and sitting around fine. 
Did some reverse kegels to realx pelvic floor and some yoga for a couple of days.
Basically I was constantly tensing my lower abs (probably due to increased urination due to increased anxiety). I worked it out by just standing up and consciously relaxing my core. I felt my lower abs release, then I felt them tensing again so relaxed them again. Did that yesterday and now im 95% better. Now and again I just have to consciously relax those muscles as I feel the urge slowly returning. Another way to describe it is imagine you are desperately holding on to a wee (without actually holding on to a wee) then let it go. Would advise doing it knowing your bladder is empty just in case🤣 hope you manage to understand and hope it might help someone.

660,2021-11-13T06:34:33+00:00,AoKuroOsaka,My complete recovery story,"Hello, I felt that I had to share the way I got completely recovered from health anxiety, in case it might be helpful for someone else. The solution was simple yet I hardly saw it being mentioned during my days of constantly googling. Maybe because it isn't intuitive at first glance.
First, a bit of context. My worst and last episode lasted for a couple of months continuously and happened a couple of years ago in my mid-twenties. You can skip this paragraph if you don't want to read symptoms, but basically I started with constant internal trembling and as days passed I had almost every imaginable symptoms: A lot of chest pain, sometimes to the point I was certain I would have a heart attack; jelly legs, it was impossible to walk a block or two, doing groceries was a nightmare if I ever dared to get out of home; constant dizziness, sometimes I woke up and got so dizzy I couldn't get out of bed and spent many days bedridden; eyesight issues, every possible muscular tension, constant fear, constant paranoia that I had this or that desease, constant googling, breathing issues... you name it.
During this time, I tried everything as well. Every possible combination of inhaling and exhaling in breathing exercises, ""grounding"", ""mindfulness"", counting 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch and blah blah; taking pills, drinking specific teas... Of course going to ER and being told I was ok, only to feel terrible a couple of minutes later. Until I found a solution posted by another guy on a FB group.
I'll try to explain my solution the best way I can:
First, you have to be aware of what is going on. This is the way that I was explained, the way I understood it and the way it worked for me.

Forget about the cause. Disregard the origin of your health anxiety. It doesn't matter if it started because of a traumatic incident, or because of continuous stressful situations, or because you have a lot of responsibilities, etc. It doesn't matter and you don't have to dwell on it to get rid of the anxiety. The process would be the same.
You need to accept this understanding. Has it happened to you that you were just there, not really paying attention, and someone scared you from behind? At the moment you feel a lot of sudden fear. What did you to get back to your normal state? Think about it. The answer is... You did nothing. Really. You did nothing to stop being scared. Once you understood you were not in danger, you did nothing, yet you recovered. Seriously. Did you say ""I'll activate normal mode now!""? No. You just let your body release the fear, the stress, and quickly but gradually came back to normal.
Health anxiety is the same, it just takes longer. No matter the symptom, it is present because your body is dealing with releasing accumulated stress. For some reason your body got a lot of stress, it manifested as some symptom, then you worried and feared it and in doing so you added more stress, and your body needs to release it again and it manifests symptoms again, creating a never ending cycle. The more you worry, the more you google symptoms, the more you read material about this, the more you pay attention.... the more stress you add for your body to release later. So how do you stop the cycle?
Abandon the battle. It sounds paradoxical, but in order to win the battle against health anxiety you have to let go of the battle. By doing so, you won't add more stress, and your body will be able to release the existing one, until you are recovered. That's it. But you might wonder, what am I supposed to do when I feel the symptoms? Do these:


Take care, but don't care. When you feel a symptom, take care of it, but don't do it with the expectation of making it go away, just to simply do the best for you at the moment. Say you feel dizzy on the street. Take care of it, by for example resting for a bit, laying on a bench, whatever, but don't expect that by doing so, it will go away. Because there's nothing you do that can cure yourself, only your body can cure itself. There's just no single action that will make you get cured; but you don't need to act, your body will take care of it and you trust it. So you are just taking care of your symptoms but you are aware that it's just stress being released by your body. Let go of control, because you don't have control to begin with. But your body has control, so trust it. Delete the responsibility of healing to your body. You do nothing.
Reduce importance. This might sound extreme but it helped me a lot. I stopped wishing to feel better. I stopped putting pressure on myself that I had to get better. I removed the burden that I had that I needed to be healthy, recovered. I even removed myself from the need to be alive. I appreciated the time I was alive, the human experiences good or bad that I had. I accepted that even if I died that day or my symptoms were actually coming from a real desease, I would be ok with it. And I really was. I accepted my human experience had to end at some point, and released the need to feel well or even be alive. I appreciate each instant I was alive despite of my stupid symptoms, I appreciated the chance I had that very moment to tell my parent or a friend that I loved them, even appreciated that I had the possibility to drink a warm tea in my bed. I completely surrendered. Yet deep down I keep the knowledge that my natural state was to be alive and healthy, and that the most probable scenario was that I was gonna be fine in a matter of days.

So, that's it. Since the day I was given this explanation, I started living in a way that felt detached from my symptoms, basically assuming I was already healthy, despite feeling my symptoms. To give a rough timeline, the first two days I felt 80% of the previous intensity and was sure this was going to work. One week later I was like 20%, and two weeks later I felt fully recovered, even though some muscles were still a little weak from so much tension. A month after that, I was just enjoying life and couldn't even remember what was like to feel health anxiety.",62,Create an account,https://old.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/qsvapx/my_complete_recovery_story/,,,,,1,1133,25.72,40.59,75.81,9.26,15.74,6.44,2.65,3.8,3.18,0.62,2.56,2.12,0,0,0,9.09,2.82,1.15,0.09,0.26,0,0.79,6.27,0.09,0.09,0,0.09,0.44,0,0,0.44,1.06,0.09,0.26,0.44,0.26,0,6.62,4.32,1.06,0.62,0.18,0,0,0.35,0.09,1.41,0.18,1.77,0.35,0.18,0.35,6.27,6.53,4.15,2.21,16.95,6.71,6.44,0.44,0.09,1.77,1.5,0
661,2021-11-04T03:08:46+00:00,riccarjo,"PSA: HA and OCD are very similar issues. Since treating my anxiety like a symptom of OCD and NOT like a symptom of normal anxiety, I've noticed incredible progress.","The most helpful resources about OCD  I found are from Dr. Michael Greenberg.  He has a few very short and simple articles about OCD, but they are the most helpful thing I've read for my health anxiety.  I can't stress that you should read them even if you just have minor health anxiety, as they may help you.  https://drmichaeljgreenberg.com/articles/
​
As for my story, I'm meeting with a new therapist and finally admitting to myself that I may actually suffer from mild/moderate OCD.  It runs in my family, I always knew I had tendencies, but I always was too ashamed to admit that it actually was a huge part of my anxieties as well.
The problem with OCD is that you see it portrayed in the media as quirkiness, being obsessed with order, etc.  That's actually just a very small subset of OCD.  There's so many more ""versions"" of OCD that no one talks about, and because of that, people don't realize it's OCD unless they're washing their hands/turning light switches.
I had a relatively real health scare recently.  Was diagnosed with EoE and Chronic gastritis.  Is it something I need to be aware of and take care of?  Yes.  Did it necessitate me spending weeks and weeks googling every symptom, looking at my own poop, calling all my friends that are nurses, losing sleep, not eating, etc.?  
No.  
No matter what I did, though, I couldn't calm my fear down.  I kept trying to find some smidgen of evidence that would put me at ease.  The problem was that even when I found the piece of information I wanted, my brain would immediately discredit it and try to find something else.  I was chasing the dragon, and never getting to where I wanted to be.  
Over the ups and downs of the last few months, I started to really notice similarities between my emotions and anxieties, and that of someone with OCD.  I read article after article, not about my health, but about OCD.  I felt understood, and heard, for the first time.  Turns out health anxiety is a form of OCD, just as the person who washes their hands frequently, or has to close and reopen doors constantly.  It's just that the routines and the compulsions are mental and not physical.  I had no idea that was a thing.
You might have OCD if your health anxiety does the following:
You could be watching TV, not focused on anything else, out of nowhere you get a thought.  
""Oh wait, I never checked out that bump on my leg""
You immediately feel a wave of panic, you start sweating, you feel cold.  You feel like the world is ending, like your seconds from death.  It sounds stupid now, but in the moment it feels so incredibly real.  
This is your intrusive thought.  
Your next response is to check the lump.  Push it.  Prod it.  Shine a flashlight on it.  Look at it in different mirrors.
This is a compulsion.
It's not enough, your fear is getting worse.  You hop onto your phone and start frantically googling. ""Lump on leg"" ""signs of skin cancer""  ""lump on leg serious?"" ""symptoms of bone cancer"" ""Symptoms of hypo-thyroidism"" etc. etc.
This is another compulsion.
Eventually you're exhausted.  Your spent.  The adrenaline is gone and you're just scared and anxious.  You slowly recover and try to live your life again.  Only to have the entire cycle repeat.
Just like the person who touched a door knob and needs to wash their hands endlessly.  You are hit with an anxious thought and need to ""cleanse"" your anxiety by finding evidence that will tell you you're ok.  However, just like with the hand washer, just once isn't enough.  Your brain requires more and more and more until your hands are bleeding or your mind is a mess.
This is OCD, and the sooner you start treating your HA like this, the better.  I promise.
​
I have so much more to say, but I think the articles I listed above will be far more helpful.  I'm also more than happy to add more or answer any questions.

I am okay, my body is okay"" and then move on to something else to focus on. That acknowledgement is the first step to getting better.
We need to -trust- that our bodies can take care of themselves. If something feels really wrong we DO NOT google it, we make an appointment and calmly go to get a checkup and then trust the doctor, get a second opinion if you absolutely must. Your body is a highly functional machine and is not going to randomly shut down. If a problem persists, go get it checked out. However, most of the time the symptoms will disappear as soon as we get focused on something else (exercise, a book, conversation, cooking, cuddling, sex, etc.)
The mind loves to saturate itself in negative thoughts, it takes work to challenge and change those thoughts!
So many people have terrible health issues and recover just fine and live good lives. 
Hyperfousing on what could happen prevents us from living well and healthily - which is what we all want, to be healthy and live well. 
I also find it useful to acknowledge what I am afraid of - I'm not scared of dying - eternal sleep sounds pleasant. 
I'm afraid of not living well and not living up to my potential.
I have dreams, goals and ambitions and I want to live to see them, and I don't want to suffer or be struck down. That is so normal and human. This also means that you have things in your life that you value, things worth living for. 
I can plan for the best and be prepared for the worst without giving in to false alarms. It's part of the balancing act of a mature, emotionally stable and healthy life.
So instead of living in fear of what could happen I'm going to try to live my best right now. Which means not googling, not focusing on illness etc., but focusing on wellness instead. 
I thank my body for everything it does for me, and tell my brain to stfu, haha.

The anxiety stopped dead in its tracks, though haha","EDIT: ""Finding,"" not ""finfing"" in the title. Typed this on the phone so please excuse the typos. 
EDIT 2: The annual ""physical"" exam is actually a blanket term I used because it included a whole lot of other tests apart from the actual physical like a blood test, checking blood pressure, xray, and urinalysis. The Xray was for the chest area. I had it immediately before the actual physical exam with the doctor. The physical included the basic check of the eyes, ears, if there are any lumps where there aren't supposed to be lumps, etc. 
So, yeah. This took a turn. My company sponsors an annual physical exam and the moment I walked in the clinic, it was like I was dropped in the ocean. When I found out that an xray is part of the physical exam, the nerves kicked into high gear and made me think about finding spots or a tumor in my lungs. Thinking about it worsened my anxiety, which made me experience shortness of breath, which just made my lung cancer anxiety worse. When I got to the bit where the doctor was looking inside my ears, she suddenly said with a bit of trepidation, ""uhhh... Did you know you there is an insect in your left ear?"" I was like WAT. The bug (it is dead) is most likely a small roach who decided to make a bachelor pad out of my ear canal. Unfortunately the EMT specialist is out for the day so I was not able to get rid of it today (I will come back tomorrow). My cancer related health anxiety literally disappeared in an instant because now I am faced with an actual problem. The anxiety still comes back in waves, but it is not the same strength as before now that my mind is more occupied with this new issue. I guess this is the universe telling me that hey, you can stop thinking you have cancer because you have an actual problem here.",65,Create an account,https://old.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/d1r2ky/had_my_annual_physical_exam_today_was_scared_of/,,,,,1,373,67.09,7.75,97.21,5.07,16.95,4.02,1.07,2.95,2.14,0.27,1.88,1.88,0,0,0,4.56,1.88,0.27,0.27,0,0.27,1.34,2.41,0,0,0.27,0.27,0.27,0,0,0.27,3.49,0,0,3.49,0,0,9.92,3.75,2.68,0,0,0,0,0,0.54,0,0,0.8,0,0,0,5.63,7.51,4.83,1.07,15.28,6.17,4.56,0.27,0,0.27,4.02,0
672,2019-01-16T19:22:42+00:00,formalde_heidi,Some very helpful words to put things in perspective,"This is an article I found that makes me feel profoundly better every time I read it. I posted it as a comment a few weeks ago, but I thought it might reach/help more people as its own post. It seems relevant to some recent posts on this sub. I'll post the url in the comments, but here it is:
""We all worry about our health from time to time, at least to some degree, but some people worry excessively about catastrophic consequences of seemingly benign symptoms. They’re known as hypochondriacs.
This is the sort of process hypochondriacs go through: what’s that? A benign lump or malignant bump on your face, breast or rump? Adrenaline rush, heart pumping, sweating, and light-headedness follow, confirming the gravity of the terminal self-diagnosis.
Thoughts racing and images of a foreshortened future, orphaned children, and opportunities missed. Overwhelming distress. Must plan the epitaph – see, I told you I was sick!
Our future and physical health are inherently uncertain. But people with hypochondriasis immediately resolve any uncertainty about novel physical sensations and symptoms on the side of catastrophe.
The body is constantly in a state of flux. The heart pumps, blood flows, muscles twitch, lungs inflate, and bowels contract. Strange symptoms come and go. And most pass without conscious awareness as we focus on daily tasks.
But try this. Hold your hand upwards, so that your palm and fingertips face the sky. Focus all your attention on the tips of your fingers and wait …and wait …until you notice some sensations. Tingling, temperature changes, or just an awareness of the sensations on your skin.
Here’s an even simpler task. As you read this, shift your attention on to the sensations of the ground or chair pushing up against your body. Chances are you were unaware of all these sensations just moments ago.
Attention, you see, is the microscope of the mind. It can filter in or out any of your internal or external experiences.
Now imagine becoming hypervigilant to all the physical changes naturally occurring in your body. Try it. Just focus on all the sensations in your body for a minute. Amazing, isn’t it? Itchy toes, tense jaw, mild headache, numbness, and so on. All the normal workings of a healthy body.
People with somatic symptom disorder are experts at searching for and noticing normal bodily changes. They’re also experts at interpreting these in potentially catastrophic ways – fatigue is leukemia; a lump on the arm is cancer.
The number one enemy of someone with the disorder is Dr Google (“cyberchondria”). Indeed, the only thing more catastrophically creative than a hypochondriac’s mind is Google’s 2.42 million webpages on the causes of cancer. Every possible symptom can be linked to every possible diagnosis, by at least one disreputable source or another.
The hypochondriac is searching not for information, but for confirmation of their imminent demise. If they’re unlucky, they might come across contradictory information or additional ailments they hadn’t yet considered.
Their intense worry and anxiety feel intolerable and must be neutralised. Seeking out a sympathetic doctor or other source of reassurance, or avoiding the health section of the newspaper all provide temporary relief until the next physical symptom is perceived.
So what are some things that keep hypochondriacs worrying?
Belief: worrying will help me catch something early.
No, it won’t. Worrying will just keep you miserable until you’re old enough to find out how you will shuffle off this mortal coil (unless, of course, your demise is a blissfully brief surprise). Worry itself will not get you any closer to predicting, preventing, or planning for your death.
Belief: I can get certainty about my health.
Nope, can’t get that either. No amount of checking, doctor visits, Googling, reassurance-seeking will guarantee with 100% certainty that you’re well. I can, however, guarantee that the unrelenting pursuit of certainty will make you miserable.
So, how can you manage health anxiety?
First, develop some healthy guidelines for monitoring your health and stick to them.
Based on your past experience, how long do benign symptoms typically last? One day, two days, one week? Decide how long you will wait before seeking any form of certainty or reassurance (from the internet, friends, family, or medical practitioners) the next time you notice a symptom, especially ones you’ve worried about in the past. Once this time expires (no pun intended), make a decision about whether you need to get the symptom checked or whether you can wait another little while before doing so. Follow guidelines from reputable sources about the recommended frequency of body checking.
And, be willing to sit with uncertainty about your health. None of us ever have certainty about our health. I could have a brain tumour as I write these words. I am willing to accept this possibility and shift my attention onto the next paragraph.
Think about it this way: if I offered you a $2 million insurance policy for your house, even if I promised to build you a gold-plated replacement if it were destroyed, you would likely consider it far too expensive.
So, how much are you willing to pay to prevent any possibility of illness? Are you willing to give up your capacity to work, time you would otherwise spend with friends and family, and ultimately your happiness? This is a very high price to pay.
Spend energy on things you truly value, rather than wasting it on a false insurance policy. Learn to accept uncertainty about your health. Revel in not knowing when or how the end will come. Focus instead on the time between now and then.
Ultimately, what you have to decide is which epitaph you would prefer when your inevitable end arrives: “lived decades in misery and fear of death”, or “didn’t see that coming but my life was far richer for it.”",65,Create an account,https://old.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/agoo0y/some_very_helpful_words_to_put_things_in/,,,,,1,981,50.14,66.43,73.07,21.48,14.01,5.1,2.55,2.45,2.45,0.31,1.83,1.33,0,0.1,0,9.79,2.45,0.51,0.1,0.1,0,0.71,7.34,0.2,0.2,0,0,0.51,0,0,0.51,1.73,0.1,0.1,0.61,0.92,0,8.66,4.59,0.82,0.2,0.61,0,0,0,0.41,0.41,0,0.71,0,0.2,0.1,6.12,2.14,4.99,2.14,18.76,6.83,6.32,0.92,0.1,1.63,2.96,0

686,2019-07-28T19:52:08+00:00,JstnBrc,I'm starting to feel like myself again,"After nearly a year of panic-induced Googling and r/HealthAnxiety scouring, countless unnecessary doctor's visits, eight months of counselling, and my first month of anxiety meds, I'm finally starting to feel like myself again.
Last fall, I experienced, what I believe to be, my first full-blown panic attack. There was nothing overly stressful happening in my life at the time and the intense physical effects that came with it had me 100% convinced that something was extremely wrong with my body. During the following months, I felt on-and-off tingling throughout my body, near-constant headaches, more trips to the bathroom than I could even attempt to keep track of, and a very counterproductive amount of time online. 
Every trip to a doctor or to a blood lab left me feeling like they were somehow missing my very obvious, very critical condition. The fear I held onto the most was that I was diabetic. Despite multiple blood work results telling me otherwise, I was convinced. I bought a blood sugar tester and began obsessively monitoring my sugar levels. To no surprise, my levels were normal. I would always feel some sense of relief, but it never lasted. It was like I wanted them to be abnormal so that I could hang onto some tangible reason for why I felt the way I did.
After about three months of this, I finally began to entertain the idea that anxiety was at the root of what I was going through. I've been going to counselling about once a month for the past eight months and doing short meditation exercises at least a few times a week. I was amazed by how much I had improved; I was still aware of the odd ways I was feeling, but they felt like more of an annoyance than the intense fear they had been. After six months of this, I went on a three-week vacation (that had been planned before any of this) and forced myself to leave the blood sugar tester at home. It was a rough several days at first, but I soon realized that what I thought was helping me feel in control was really just making things worse.
When I got back, I fell into some of the same patterns I had formed before the trip. I started testing my blood regularly again, checking my urine with home test strips (gross, I know,) and checking in with Dr. Google every day or two. This time, however, I recognized that what I was doing was anxiety-driven and not helping my situation. I made an appointment with my family doctor and with my counsellor and made the decision to start taking anxiety medication.
A month later, and I'm starting to feel in control again. I don't feel totally ""normal"" again, nor did I really expect to. That same tingling sensation comes up from time to time, but it doesn't send me into the slump it once did. I think I finally understand that just because I'm not feeling anxious, doesn't mean anxiety isn't there.
I've still got a ways to go, but I'm really hopeful for the future.

After i got my shot, it was kind of hard to tell what was an anxiety response or an actual side effect.

And so far the only side effect that has me a little on edge was tingling in the face. Being a symptom of anxiety i don't know whether or not that  is caused by anxiety or a side effect of the vaccine.  
Obviously the instant that happened i thought i was having an allergic reaction and kind of had to collect myself.

My chest aches with anxiety pangs, it must be that my heart is failing. I just had another palpitation. See? It's over. My IBS has gotten worse lately, must be colorectal cancer.

No, things aren’t perfect and I still have some fears.  But they are normal levels, not all-consuming.  And I don’t latch on and ruminate, I’m able to move on much more quickly.

Heights and Loud sounds. I know it’s not easy. It’s not gonna be as easy tomorrow as it was today for me. I know this.
