I think we might be going about this wrong.
It is VERY hard to get people to change their minds about almost ANY topic. If they have a stance, for whatever reason, getting them to see beyond their ""side"" and see reason is right next to impossible. Not impossible, but right next to it. 
It takes a certain mindset to take on information that might run contrary to you thoughts and then process it to have understanding. Kind of what scientist do: their theory or experiment is contrary to what they hypothesized, that's good because they have learned SOMETHING.
But most in society feels that their personal identity is wrapped up in an issue and will fight for that until the end. It's noble to stand for something. To stand up for those that can't stand for themselves. And it is all that. But what if you are wrong. How do you help people to the truth? Will they accept it no matter how it is presented? 
I'm not a psychologist, but I would think that there is a manner of steps to get people to see that they are on the wrong side. Not yelling, accusing, or abusing or giving out Herman Caine awards.
This was STUPIDLY made a political issue early on and it has divided people for that reason. It's not that they don't believe in science, they just don't trust the people that are telling them it's science.
They aren't refusing all the other science based help. The myriad of meds that are getting pumped into them. Other people's plasma that came from who knows where. The instruments that intubate and resuscitate. The beeps and whirls that try to keep them alive.
This needs addressed at a level that isn't political and we need to address it in a way to help those with fears to understand that nothing is perfect and nothing in life is guaranteed, except death. And we are trying to postpone that as best we can even though it is not perfect.

5,218,SmolWeens,"True that. 
The worst are the out-of-town daughters. When I worked on the floor, I once had three for a patient once whose entire ass was eaten by necrotizing fasciitis. None of the daughters communicated with each other, one was a super misinformed nurse, and one shift, there was a different daughter at the bedside every time I walked into the room and I had to keep repeating the treatment plan. The entitlement they felt to their mom‚Äôs treatment was insane. I was walked over more than a doormat. A lot of the family aggression comes from guilt if not being there when it happened, or not being in touch with the family member who is sick, so they overcompensate by berating staff. 
The meanest family member I ever had was the wife of a patient who refused dialysis and ended up having to have some calcified tissue removed from his legs (it was really weird, I haven‚Äôt seen anything like it since). She was an absolute monster to me, because I couldn‚Äôt make the patient go to dialysis. She was watching him die and angry at him for it, so I got the brunt of that anger. For two weeks I dealt with abusive language from her. That was my first year of nursing. It‚Äôs been almost four now, and I sometimes wish I could go back in time and defend myself, and tell that woman all the things that needed to be said‚Äîthat case was part of why I left the floor and went to the OR. I did everything in my power to try and keep the patient happy. I remember him getting on the waffle mattress after I‚Äôd made the bed with one, and he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd go to dialysis if they gave me this!‚Äù So I gave them an extra. In retrospect, it wouldn‚Äôt have made a difference. He would have refused treatment either way. I‚Äôm sure he no longer walks among the living. I hope his wife has moved on and is happier.

6,293,Comrade_Corgo,"The question of the privileged position of the officials as organs of state power is raised here. The main point indicated is: what is it that places them above society?
‚ÄúBecause the state arose from the need to hold class antagonisms in check, but because it arose, at the same time, in the midst of the conflict of these classes, it is, as a rule, the state of the most powerful, economically dominant class, which, through the medium of the state, becomes also the politically dominant class, and thus acquires new means of holding down and exploiting the oppressed class....‚Äù The ancient and feudal states were organs for the exploitation of the slaves and serfs; likewise, ‚Äúthe modern representative state is an instrument of exploitation of wage-labor by capital.""
In a democratic republic, ‚Äúwealth exercises its power indirectly, but all the more surely‚Äù, first, by means of the ‚Äúdirect corruption of officials‚Äù (America); secondly, by means of an ‚Äúalliance of the government and the Stock Exchange‚Äù (France and America)... At present, imperialism and the domination of the banks have ‚Äúdeveloped‚Äù into an exceptional art both these methods of upholding and giving effect to the omnipotence of wealth in democratic republics of all descriptions.
Mr. Palchinsky obstructed every measure intended for curbing the capitalists and their marauding practices, their plundering of the state by means of war contracts; and since later on Mr. Palchinsky, upon resigning from the Cabinet (and being, of course, replaced by another quite similar Palchinsky), was ‚Äúrewarded‚Äù by the capitalists with a lucrative job with a salary of 120,000 rubles per annum ‚Äî what would you call that? Direct or indirect bribery? An alliance of the government and the syndicates, or ‚Äúmerely‚Äù friendly relations? What role do the Chernovs, Tseretelis, Avksentyevs and Skobelevs play? Are they the ‚Äúdirect‚Äù or only the indirect allies of the millionaire treasury-looters?
Another reason why the omnipotence of ‚Äúwealth‚Äù is more certain in a democratic republic is that it does not depend on defects in the political machinery or on the faulty political shell of capitalism. A democratic republic is the best possible political shell for capitalism, and, therefore, once capital has gained possession of this very best shell (through the Palchinskys, Chernovs, Tseretelis and Co.), it establishes its power so securely, so firmly, that no change of persons, institutions or parties in the bourgeois-democratic republic can shake it.
In capitalist society, providing it develops under the most favourable conditions, we have a more or less complete democracy in the democratic republic. But this democracy is always hemmed in by the narrow limits set by capitalist exploitation, and consequently always remains, in effect, a democracy for the minority, only for the propertied classes, only for the rich. Freedom in capitalist society always remains about the same as it was in the ancient Greek republics: freedom for the slave-owners. Owing to the conditions of capitalist exploitation, the modern wage slaves are so crushed by want and poverty that ""they cannot be bothered with democracy"", ""cannot be bothered with politics""; in the ordinary, peaceful course of events, the majority of the population is debarred from participation in public and political life.",30 points,2022-02-08T02:06:36+00:00,,,,,1,527,96.28,36.8,20.92,20.23,31,3.8,1.9,1.9,0.57,0.19,0.38,0,0.19,0.19,0,7.02,4.17,0.76,0.38,0.38,0.19,0.57,3.42,0,0,0,0.38,7.21,6.83,0.19,0.19,6.83,0.57,0,2.28,4.36,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.19,0.19,0.38,0.38,0.19,0,2.85,0.95,4.55,0,21.63,3.61,8.92,1.14,0,0,7.97,0

Also, I went to nursing school 20 years ago but only worked as a HCP for a few years.  It wasn't for me. So I keep up on medical-legal issues, even though I don't practice any more. 
So... it partially depends on where you live. In regular times, not telling the patient could affect your license (bc yes, I agree that it's an ethical issue). 
But....Right now, some States have executive orders in place that - in practice - are limiting the legal liability of HCP's and hospitals. 
Ex. In MD right now, HCP's can practice with an out of state or retired/inactive license, practice outside of their scope of practice, etc. 
This - combined with the CDC 5 day BS - essentially removes much of the legal liability from both hospitals and HCP's. 
But we've never been in this situation before, so it's hard to say what the real effect will ultimately be. Specifically whether you could actually lose your license.  We just don't know, but IMO, it's prob unlikely, esp if your state has certain executive orders in place, etc.
This is (ostensibly?) to allow hospitals to continue operating, but at a huge cost to nurses, patients, etc. I don't need to explain that you to guys.

But covid ups and downs has me feeling bipolar some days. I want my patients back, I don‚Äôt want my patients back, my patient is going home, my patient is dying, my patient is alive but will never leave this hospital, except in a body bag. 
The family calls for another update. 3rd time this shift. Nothing has changed. They tell me they keep praying for a miracle. I can‚Äôt bring myself to respond. Not even a hum of ‚Äúmmhm‚Äù to humor them. Sometimes I feel so inadequate.

13,649,rych6805,"I think this story is something people need to hear. Depending on how OP feels about it and how they best process the emotions associated with this story, I think writing about this harrowing experience in-depth could be extremely valuable to not only other nurses, but non nurses like myself.
Well-written testimonies like this give an in-depth understanding of what was going on in some COVID wards across the country and can be a warning for future nurses and doctors when the next pandemic comes around. OP mentions that their schooling never prepared them for the difficult decisions they had to make or the traumatic emotions they endured. After hearing this, Im reminded of a colleague who is studying and writing a thesis on medical education that advocates for additional curriculum to prepare medical workers for the emotional and physical toll that this work can take. It is no doubt that stories like this would be a vital part of that education and perhaps help prepare future nurses and doctors for the unseen difficulties of their work. Furthermore, even as a physicist who's never studied medicine and can't begin to imagine the job of a nurse in a COVID ward, reading this provoked a strong emotional response and has given me a much deeper understanding of the effects of the pandemic on medical workers.
Ultimately, I want to thank OP for sharing this story with the public. I consider myself extremely lucky to have found it by chance and offer my best wishes and sincerest sympathy to those medical workers who worked on the front line during this pandemic.

15,732,Anonymous,"I read your post thinking maybe, maybe there was a happy ending, and then hit your ""I provided his post-mortem care"" sentence.  
I have a classmate who is preaching the whole ""Medical Freedom"" BS to give her an excuse to not get the vaccine -- we head into OB clinicals this trimester, and our university has mandated that everyone is fully vaccinated by 10/31, which is when OB clinicals will likely be over for the 1st mini session (of which she is a member).
She posts regularly on FB on how a certain state has classified C-19 as a ""flu"" (it's not) - and how ""vaccinated and unvaccinated nurses should be able to work together to treat people and end the pandemic,"" AND how ""the vaccine can't be that effective because vaccinated people are still being admitted to ICU"" (even though that's entirely patient-specific and can be influenced by many comorbidities etc..... but the echo chamber doesn't give a fuck).  
I didn't really have a mom (victim of horrific child abuse), and so I feel EXTRA protective of neos & PEDS -- one reason why I can't work in the field-- I'll end up punching someone who ignores basic science at the detriment of their child.

23,1121,TriceratopsBites,"Yeah, a lot of nurses and RTs tried that at my job. Unfortunately the decision is in the hands of the higher-up administrators, and they decided to keep paying travelers $160/hr and not give staff one cent more. Oh actually, they offered $500 bonuses for additional shifts, but we were already doing extra work (getting 3 patients in the icu, or pairing two 1:1 patients). My unit manager‚Äôs hands were tied. She can only work within the budget that administration allocates. It was such a bad decision on their part, especially considering we had a 26 bed CVICU and a lot of amazing (specialty) nurses. But our staff started to leave, and there were fewer and fewer non-travelers. It takes time for cardiothoracic surgeons to trust their nurses. It takes time to build that relationship, and to know what each surgeon likes, what I should have done (labs, ekg, xray, etc) before I call them at 3am. Things continued to go downhill in the unit because the travelers didn‚Äôt know the surgeons and their quirks (how could they with one day of orientation?!) When I looked at the upcoming schedule and saw that they had me in charge with a bunch of travelers that I hadn‚Äôt even met, I put in my notice. It‚Äôs one thing to have a few travelers helping with a majority of staff nurses. I‚Äôm always glad to answer questions and give advice about the particulars of our unit. I don‚Äôt want the patients to have bad outcomes, and nobody likes an angry CT surgeon at 6am. But when I‚Äôm the ONLY staff nurse and I‚Äôm in charge of travelers with unknown (to me) backgrounds and skill sets, that‚Äôs just administration continuing to risk MY license for their bottom line. It‚Äôs really sad because it WAS a great place to work with a fantastic culture and very little turn-over of staff. I was very sad to leave, but too angry to stay. So I‚Äôm now a free agent looking for my first travel assignment, which is scary for me, but not as scary as the thought of opening a chest at the bedside when I‚Äôm probably the only one who knows where the open-chest stuff is stored. Then they (administration all around the country, actually) tried to gaslight us by saying that nurses were quitting because of vaccine mandates BEFORE THE MANDATES STARTED. I‚Äôm talking back in July, August, September, October. I saw it all over the news and it made so angry at administration for making us the bad guys! Unfortunately, I know that my story is similar to so many of us right now. I hope it works out and you get the $50/hr. I would have stayed for $70 (until the crisis is over, of course), which I think is reasonable. Administration doesn‚Äôt operate reasonably.

""This post has some nice sentiments but the repested referals tl angry surgeons illustrates how poor of a place that must be to work in. The quirks of a surgeon should have no bearing on the work flow ... ""
I just have to say that I can tell you've never worked with a cardiothoracic surgeon. Most of them have huge egos and a god complex because they literally put patients into cardiac and respiratory arrest for about an hour and then repair them and bring them back to life (with the help of about 9 other people). Their work is amazing. Heart programs bring in a ton of money for hospitals, and only select facilities are able to provide this specialized care. Of the 11 hospitals in that group, the hospital I worked for is the only one with a heart program. My coworkers and I often comment that their egos don't bother us as long as they're good surgeons. The outcome is the important part. They like things the way they like things because they care about the outcomes also. I don't think it's unreasonable for the surgeon to expect morning lab results, a morning CXR, and post-op EKG because those are things that determine whether the patient will downgrade to the stepdown unit or spend another night in the ICU. One of the surgeons likes more frequent labs, sometimes every two hours. She likes more frequent ABGs. That definitely puts a kink in my workflow, but I do it because she‚Äôs the doctor, those are her orders, and I trust her. That hospital system is probably the best I've encountered in my 13 year career. Amazing HCWs, amazing middle management, amazing perks. There are jerk doctors in every area of healthcare. I don‚Äôt think a jerk doctor defines the quality of an entire unit.

So‚Ä¶ CPS is always very reluctant to step in with super high needs patients. For one, they are lay people when it comes to medical needs.

ironically, i‚Äôve actually had a really bad experience with them, personally, that led to me having a negative overall perception of CPS and social workers in general (the tl;dr is, my deadbeat dad didn‚Äôt wanna pay for the court-ordered therapy to get unsupervised visits after my parents divorced, so he made multiple blatantly and maliciously false reports to CPS against my medically-fragile mother, and our case got a naive and judgmental idiot of a social worker who ripped apart my family‚Äôs lives and wasted multiple years of everyone‚Äôs time, energy, and resources).

29,1416,lemonade4,"We have received reports that the nurse staffing agencies are vastly inflating price, by two, three or more times pre-pandemic rates, and then taking 40% or more of the amount being charged to the hospitals for themselves in profits. We have heard the amounts charged to hospitals rose precipitously as the newest wave of the COVID-19 crisis swept the nation and the agencies seemingly seized the opportunity to increase their bottom line. 

I do not have a problem with Congress investigating this piece. Price gauging should be taken seriously and I certainly wasn‚Äôt aware that an agency is taking up to 40% of what the hospital is being charged. That‚Äôs a lot. I don‚Äôt know the history enough to know if that‚Äôs new or not. It seems reasonable to look into this. 

Hospitals have no choice but to pay these exorbitant rates because of the dire workforce needs facing hospitals around the country.

Now THIS I do have a problem with. Why is this stated as fact? They absolutely have another option which is to pay staff nurses fairly, give us good benefits (like what is seen in other industries‚Äîvacation time, maternity leave, healthcare that isn‚Äôt garbage or tied to their dumbass stated religions), and incentives for retention. It makes it clear that this request is not coming from a balanced, objective place. 
I do not know the US house representatives very well but I notice my own house (moderate democrat) is not supporting this. But some very progressive ones are (Ilhan Ohmar and Ayanna Presley) and some far right republicans (Miller-Meeks in my own state and legendary asshole Paul Gosar). It makes me wonder

Travelling can be tough however. It's more challenging because you constantly feel like you are being thrown in the middle of a plot. They spend a day or two showing you where things are and that's it. Sometimes you don't even get log in ID cards until your second week so you depend on other RNs to get you in and out of medrooms, supply areas, or floors.

Also, I would like to ask why this is specifically a nursing duty? Would, for instance, a case manager or a respiratory therapist or an HR specialist or housekeeping or a deeply concerned stockholder or the CEO be able to intervene?

There is one big old gal that makes all kinds of very sexual and overt comments to the male staff. Doesn't matter if it's nurses, dietary, cleaning, or maintenance. She's just... awful. 
In all honesty, the facility has done nothing. Actually probably even less than nothing, because they certainly also did SFA when some of the young LTC care givers who were complaining about someone wanting them to wash their testicles and pull back their foreskin for him. He would pull that garbage with each newbie that came on his floor.

2 yrs ago I had cataract surgery. First I went to the little Catholic hospital. Easy as pie surgery was just under $4000. EDITED to ADD: After write-offs we paid about $900 out of pocket. 
Next Friday to do the second eye first hospital had lost the use of one of their surgical units and they could not do the surgery. So we went to the big fancy for-profit hospital. It started as a nightmare and ended as a nightmare. That surgery cost me $9600. And they refused to write off any of it. They don‚Äôt discount. 
They had redone their computer system the day before and no one knew how to use it. So my doctor took 20 minutes to log in and put in my stats and the computer person had to stand next to her and do with her. So the initial 30 minute allotted time got added onto buy 2 extra 20 minutes segments. At an exorbitant rate ai can‚Äôt remember. My pharmacy bill was $2400 for eye drops my doctor didn‚Äôt prescribe. They tossed them all in the trash the next day.
Luckily for us, or not, hubby had bladder surgery earlier in the year and wiped out all deductible and co-pay so we were clear. Otherwise it was about $4500 out of pocket. 
When I told my eye doctor she went white. I only shared with her because she has a lot of elderly patients And while I could cover the extra $4500 they would have charged me a lot of people cannot cover that. She took my bill copies and said  thank you telling me and that she was now going back to her office to have a small heart attack.

Well that night, I was at the end of our largest station, having finished with a patient, I was walking back to the station.
One of the CNAs on the station with the quad bypass, ran up to me and said the other nurse needed me for a code. So I start running. I get the room to see her trying to CPR (this was before defib paddles were available) on this man. 
He was only half on the CPR board, but she wouldn't move it as she was doing CPR and I was doing the respiration (old-time CPR). I was nervous, as this was my first ""code"".
Prior to helping her, I had called 911, since the fire station was one house down from us, they got here pretty quickly. I later learned he was DOA (dead upon arrival) upon arrival.
One of the CNAs told me that the nurse had seen him fall out of a chair onto the floor. She and tne CNAs put him back on the bed. Instead of having me paged, she sent the CNA to look for me.

hospitals are paid to kill covid patients and that's why they won't do X and Y and Z flavor of the month treatment.

Even if we look at this from a purely economical standpoint, killing patients is bad for business. If the goal is to generate money, it would make more sense to keep your patients sick for a longer period of time and run up the bill. Patient deaths put a very final ending to the ability to bill patients...also, there are limits to the ways in which a healthcare institution can collect from an estate of a deceased individual. 

Well obviously they are keeping the patients sicker longer by not administering [insert random ineffective medication or vitamin supplement or rectal sunshine here]

All of the medications being talked about are unapproved and have shown limited to no effectiveness in the treatment of COVID. And while I know you're going to cite the very few studies that show Ivermectin works, I'm going to point out that those are in vitro and the dosage in order to have an antiviral effect are well beyond the dose where you start seeing toxic effects. The safe doses are consistently proven to do absolutely nothing.
What we do know is that there are absolutely effective treatments that range from vaccination (preventative), the use of monoclonal antibodies, convalescent plasma (to a point), and various cocktails of steroids, antibiotics (combat opportunistic infections), and antivirals. 
All of these things act in ways to prevent hospitalization, shorten admissions, and keep people out of the ICU. We know this, because it's the reality on the ground.

I'm not saying that what happened in the scenario described by /u/snartastic is okay, in any way. However, one nurse to 41+ patients, as an example of the high patient workload found in many of those long-term care settings, is not safe. These scenarios (not excusing any behaviors) are not just the onus of an individual, but the systems that are supposed to protect patients (laws, facility policies, auditing commissions, management...). If we don't advocate for safer patient protections, we are likely to see a continuation of these same behaviors (pressure ulcers, restricted access to certain devices, etc.).
I hope that the people responding to this post with how to report those healthcare workers, will also use their energy to write to their (political) representatives (i.e. state legislature, governor) to investigate these facilities and use that data to institute safe staffing ratios.

As long as the patients are placed in positions which offload bony prominences and at risk areas, there is really no reason to do 2 hourly. I tell my nurses to start take note of when they last repositioned, and check the skin during turns - if there are no non blanching areas you can extend the next turn.

1) Soldiers sign up for a job that could kill them, we didn't. Our bodies and lives do not belong to the US military or anyone else. We are not soldiers.
2) It makes it even harder for scared nurses to quit or draw a line. We are not cowards nor deserters if we quit over our justified safety concerns. We are not soldiers.
3) The mayor of NYC is calling for an involuntary federal military draft of healthcare workers. Comparing us to soldiers means this idea could gain traction and actually happen, forcing us into dangerous situations to work far from home, for whatever pay they want, whether we're willing or not.

54,2655,#NAME?,"About 6 years ago I forced myself to detox from a severe opiate addiction.
I wanted to go to an inpatient facility, or a hospital, anywhere really where I could at least feel like I had others (nurses, docs, not necessarily other patients) that would have a positive attitude towards what I was doing.
Everyone. And I mean everyone I asked about their time in these facilities told me that compassion wasn't something they exhibited often - if ever to patients.
So I did it alone. It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. It is true that you cannot force someone to get clean, they need to want it - and I did.
I can virtually guarantee if I had gone inpatient and the people there were indifferent/callous/hostile that I would've certainly left and started using again. I am extremely lucky I was able to do it alone, I would be dead for certain by now. I was naive to think that the ""help"" our country offers would try to at least foster an environment that consisted of some empathy.
Thank you for looking at someone in severe pain and attempting to help. It doesn't matter if they did it to themself, why do we view the motorcyclist who fails his wheelie and gets bad road rash as more of a person than myself? We all know the answer. 
It has made me very cynical. And I don't like that.
(I of course recognize this was just my situation and know there are good facilities as well just nothing I could possibly ever afford)
Edit: I guess part of what I'm trying to convey above is that an environment that was intended to foster and help people beat substance addiction IMO needs to start training? screening potential hires? I'm not sure - to have staff that would be less likely to stigmatize us.

54,2657,WhenwasyourlastBM,"This exactly! I know I can be shitty at times. As an ED nurse it's just so easy to burn out. For example, I worked in a locked psych unit within an ED for 2 years. We weren't an actual psych facility, we basically held patients until we could find an appropriate psych placement for them. Anything shitty that can be said/done to you by a patient I've either experienced myself or seen first hand. I've called my charge, the attending, security, the house supervisor, and police on patients for aggressive behavior. My peers have always been so quick to call security and security seems to worsen the situations. Then they developed a BERT program where you call code Bert and all the above come to bedside. In my opinion security should be the last one to be involved. We need figure out why a patient is being a dick instead of calling them a dick and telling them to stop.  But I'm never backed up on that thought process and I'm left alone again with a pissy patient and no new orders. 
My point is years of being met with no help from the team and dozens of bad experiences is what makes nurses like this. Just like we should help CIWA patients, we need to support ED nurses when they do right by their patient, instead of shaming them or complaining about them. I see it happen everywhere I go, ""no he doesn't need meds, he just needs to calm down"" or ""I'm not giving anything but Tylenol, she'll be fine."" (There are plenty of things between Tylenol and dilauded....) or ""if he doesn't like it he can sign out ama, I don't care"". 
We are all so busy and overworked that we get sucked into this burnt out, zero fucks trap of cognitive dissonance. When I do disagree with the provider, their isn't much to do. If I do escalate the problem I get told to ""not much you can do but chart"" or my favorite was when I literally got written up for moving up the chain of command for a patient writhing in pain, diaphoretic, and vomiting that the PA and attending wouldn't even give any Tylenol or zofran for.

Yeah I truthfully believe 99% of nurses and healthcare providing employees are like OP. Like I said above, its just made me cynical  though I'm not dense enough to believe it happens to an extreme.
And I know nothing about nursing school or what non medical classes you are all required to take, I know it looks stupid to suggest something like that but I just didn't know. And just to clarify I didn't intend it to mean medical staff should be REQUIRED to have traits such as the aforementioned ones, only that for these types of facilities (inpatient rehabs for instance) I feel it should be at least stressed to applicants that they should behave that way.
Personally, it seems odd as someone who isn't a nurse reading in this very thread about nurses that don't understand withdrawal or how to handle it. Terrifying to be completely honest. Please don't take that as an insult to the profession... It just seems... very very obvious to me that they should know this. Of course I'm probably wrong about that too. It's not as if they are being presented with patients that have an unknown ailment. Its just withdrawal, as someone with no medical training I have a hard time seeing how someone with that training can't put 2 and 2 together when it comes to their behavior during withdrawal.
Edit: you know what, maybe I can see why they don't put 2 and 2 together. You know, since to a lot of people those of us that recover are lesser beings.

A lot of staff also go by their middle names too, which seems like a smart move as well. Even if you did have somebody's ""name"" and you tried to look them up, you wouldn't find who you're looking for. I think that's smart.
One thing a seasoned psych nurse told me was that psych 101 was to go on your social media and switch up your name, make all pictures of you either unrecognizable (hair down, no ponytail, or maybe wear a wig lol) or just don't have any publicly viewable pictures of yourself.
If whatever state board has your address and whatnot publicly viewable, get a PO box and switch it to that.

And in there lies the problem. Hospital workers are expected to be able to control every situation at all times. It comes from the mentality that the hospital knows is bullshit but allows them to shirk it's responsibility for any harm done to its employees.
When something like event of the pregnant nurse happens, it will take SUING the living shit out of the hospital and making them fully responsible for our safety. And it will have to happen many times over.

The ER was insane both times. The hospitals are overworked and understaffed and at their breaking point. First admission I had to spend nearly 30 hours in the hallways before there was a room open. I needed to be there but was stable other people needed the rooms more.  But it sucked, because of what was going on I had to urgently use the restroom frequently so I had to hobble 100 feet down the hallway 50 times. I get it I wasn't dying its worse other places but I had a more painful, sleepless experience, and frankly had to discuss over and over a personal medical condition in the fucking hallway and people who weren't stable all had less care because the hospitals are overwhelmed with Covid, the staff is burnt out. The second admission I had emergency surgery so at least I got a room for 6 days.  Note when they released me the first time it was not an error they were trying to get things under control medically so the surgery could be planned and more controlled (had emergency surgery 5 days before the surgery was planned and they had to do more), my organs did not follow the plan.

You typically see ‚Äúoverprotectiveness‚Äù to the extreme. If you ask simple questions but are met with defiance at every corner by the adult, there‚Äôs a chance that they have something to hide. 
There‚Äôs a few other signs I can think of: not letting the child speak for themselves when you‚Äôre speaking with the patient, denying or arguing against necessary care, and the patient being unwilling to talk nor explaining why they chose not to. If several of these things are showing up throughout the process, you might want to look deeper into it.

Was told hang it on a doorknob or set it on something non fabric like a kitchen chair (because of bedbugs we may not be aware of at the time).  Mold growing in sinks and on walls, hardly any food in the fridge, you name it.
I think the thing that struck me the most, was seeing clients at home that I cared for in hospital previously, and vice versa.  In hospital I only saw a tiny piece or aspect of them, when seeing them in their whole home situation and setting, if they had supports or not, what their capabilities were (or not).....it explained so much about them.

If you're not getting the full 30, you are supposed to let management know so they can pay you for it because they automatically deduct it. They can get in trouble with the labor board if they're forcing you to work through lunch breaks and not paying out that 30 min.
Source: have worked at TWO healthcare facilities that had to go back years and pay people for every shift lunch break because people were going to the labor board and suing the workplace for not getting their 30 mins and not getting paid those 30 mins.

64,3153,ShiftLeader,"To preface, I am not advocating for or against vaccination or anything of that nature, simply regurgitating the information shared with me while I was trying to better understand all this.
Most modern medicine is developed or tested using one of the cell lines, HEK-293 and PER.C6 being the most common, but a few others being available.
However there is also a lot of misunderstanding about ""all the other drugs"" commonly talked about that were ""developed"" using those cell lines.
The explaination I got from our chaplains was that basically that there are entire lines of vaccines that are ""ethically"" created that people do seek out which means you can be fully vaccinated while still having an issue with the covid vaccines.
It also isn't necessary for a religious exemption to be a specific theological belief of a major religious organization, per the rulings of the supreme court. As long as it is a strong belief that is firmly held, that's all the criteria really requires. This obviously doesn't work with stuff like the news told me XYZ, but for someone with a strong belief against abortion or having strong belief about living a completely natural lifestyle (these rulings cover more than just a job at a hospital) that would qualify as a religious exemption. On top of all that, there are entire bible teachings that specifically talk about how ones beliefs are between them and God. This is basically the ""law"" that prevents the church leaders or similar body from making something fine that goes against a belief. The example the chaplain used was just because the pope says God allows abortion, doesn't mean that everyone must suddenly agree with abortion. This same teaching also goes the other way saying that just because you feel XYZ goes against God's teachings, doesn't necessarily mean that that is the same between another person and God.
In regards to medicine, the ""common"" medications talked about here like benadryl, acetaminophen, Tums, aspirin, etc are all medications that existed and were publicly available before fetal cell lines even existed. There were studies conducted on those meds with cell lines after those cell lines came into existence.
The reason that isn't a problem is essentially because something doesn't become ""morally contaminated"" just because someone does something bad with it after the fact. The chaplains example used water. Water is and has been used to torture people. Just because people used water for horrid things doesn't mean water, which initially had no morality issues, is suddenly immoral and cannot be touched.

No job or institution is static; things change all the time. I'd opine that an unprecedented global pandemic is one very good reason for a ""sudden"" change in policy  -- our government & hospitals did not set this mandate on a whim and many would argue that the FDA's delay in authorizing the vaccine so they could do so makes them responsible for many thousands of preventable deaths.
‚Äã

I have family that have been working completely remote for a healthcare system for years now. Were never even required to get the flu vaccine, but now are being mandated to get the covid vaccine simply because they work for the system. They've never even been in the same room as their coworkers, let alone seen a patient. Are they unqualified for the job now?

Re. your remote-working family members or peripheral workers like custodians etc, this is merely one in a number of institutional requirements that are possibly broader than strictly necessary, but such is the nature of employment law in practice. Welcome to living in a society. Because in the case of covid-19 the benefit also accrues to the individual worker, who dramatically lessens their personal chance of death via the vaccination, it is overall a beneficial requirement.
Custodians and other non-teaching staff at virtually all of my former colleges and universities (I just retired) are also required to get vaccinated for covid-19 as for TB and other communicable disease; in academia as in health care, we serve a population to whose well-being we are fully professionally dedicated and we do not wish to put them at greater risk of harm than necessary.
‚Äã

I don't take any medicine, I eat a healthy diet, and live a simple life.

... this is such a total non-sequitur on the topic that it leads me to think you are speaking of your own objections to the vaccine rather than in hypotheticals? (I'd wager this explains the downvotes by your professional colleagues here, it wasn't me.) 
Relatedly, ""natural immunity"" is a strangely loaded phrase; people who've gotten the vaccine also have natural immunity, unless you think there's something unnatural about how vaccines train one's immune system?
‚Äã

I've frequently seen people here say that unvaccinated are more likely to spread than vaccinated putting patients at risk, but I've not seen or been able to find the studies they're reading showing this. Anecdotally, the 3 staff outbreaks we've had on my unit over the past year have all been in fully vaccinated individuals who got it outside the hospital.  

It's simple logic: the vaccination lessens one's chance of infection by over 10x (exact statistical number escapes me, if I'm recalling correctly it's like 11.something); if I am ten times less likely to get covid, I am also 10x less likely to pass it on to someone else. This seems patently clear, even to us laypeople. The study bruited about in antivax circles as ""see? the vaxxed can carry it too! and even worse!"" that showed infected vaccinated patients carrying large viral loads, simply makes sense: to get infected in the first place, they needed a heavier exposure to the virus.
[Happy to be corrected by any nursing commenters here, which is virtually all of them, who know this data far better than I!]
‚Äã

Studies have shown natural immunity alone provides better protection against Delta than a vaccinated individual without natural immunity.

This is not my understanding; I recall the State of Kentucky study the CDC put out that showed those who'd had covid but remained unvaccinated were a little over twice as likely to get reinfected. It also appears to differ per the brand/type of covid vaccine one received. To what studies are you referring?
In addition, the cost of acquiring that potentially slightly enhanced covid-induced immunity is a VERY high social and possibly individual one, as you must know if you work in nursing right now. Far preferable to avoid it altogether via the vaccination.
‚Äã

If I brought you a lab report, without telling you what my vaccination status, that showed I had high levels of covid antibodies, would I be qualified to take care of covid patients?

Comparing Biden to Trump in this matter is just criminally misinformed. Trump had just about the worst reaction possible to this from the start. He had banked all his reelection chances on the health of the stock market, so his goal from day one was to minimize, downplay and do whatever he could to not frighten investors, at the devastating cost of losing the head start we could have got on this.

People are being laid off and applying for unemployment, where they will have to pay hundreds of dollars a month to be on COBRA.* Tying health insurance to employment when the economy is crashing is a disaster. People have absolutely NO incentive to stay home in quarantine unless they are forcibly mandated to. Plenty of people are still going to work, business as usual. In a Medicare for All model, Medicare could pay for private laboratory testing that has been responsible for the majority of the testing in my state at least. They could negotiate an appropriate fee and could test broadly like they did in South Korea. Sure, it would be late to the game due to the emergency response.

I can remember as a 12yr old passing newspapers to them (before they moved on our street a few years later). 
I loved her and her husband (who has a horrific stutter). I would go to their house after school several days a week to watch after her so hubby could do some errands.
When they moved to our street, they put a pool in their backyard to help her with her exercises. She was in a wheelchair since before I'd ever met them. I was the only teenager on the block allowed in the pool without permission, lol.
I'd help her in and out of the pool (her hubby made like a Hoyer lift thingy for her - it worked great!!) whenever she wanted to swim and I'd stay in the pool with her as long as she wanted to stay. Being a Pisces, not a bad deal!!

It was such an emotional rollercoaster, especially since I was pregnant.
I ended up trying to take a break from the vaccine issue by browsing the rest of the website. Stumbled across a rant about how smoking cigarettes doesn't cause cancer and how the government just lied about it so they could take some of those sweet tobacco revenue for themselves.
I remember sitting at the computer, just trying to process all of it, and then laughing out loud.
Yeah, ok, so this entire website is nonsense.
I did discuss the vaccine issue with our pediatrician when kiddo was born, and was offered a delayed vaccine schedule that would allow us to get one vaccine at a time with a break of several months in between. But we decided to keep to the recommended schedule.

That led me down a ton of rabbit holes about newborn procedures. When I ended up in the hospital anyway because I wasn't progressing and had an amniotic leak for 72 hours, I was terrified. The first doctor who came to see me was at the end of her shift and irritated. When I asked questions about what she was doing, she snapped at me and told me I needed to just let her do whatever she needed to keep me from having a dead baby. That set the tone for the whole experience.
Our daughter had to go to the NICU for antibiotics because she had a fever and they couldn't administer them in the nursery. The vitamin K shot was questionable to me at the time, so I tried to discuss it with the NICU doctor. Same result. He got snippy with me and tried to shut any questions down. We refused the shot because it felt like they were bullying us into things without giving us any explanation or reason to feel comfortable. 
I had our son last year. We had an amazing doctor who thoroughly explained everything to us and encouraged us to ask any questions we might have.

Why can‚Äôt the public be allowed to see?  Like what specifically is standing in the way?

This kind of stuff has the potential to do one of two things to believers - plant seeds of doubt or cause them to redouble their faith. Most go down the redoubling path.

This encapsulates, almost perfectly, the basis of Terror Management Theory. However, TMT is more narrowly focused on mortality and fear of death, but I would submit the existential terror that is engendered by a realization of the essential uncontrollability (and thus meaninglessness) of existence is the larger theme playing out in people's heads.
If it was all a lie, and there is no grand plan for me, then why bother trying?
It leads, kind of inevitably, to the philosophical problem of suicide. If life has no meaning, and there's no plan for me or anybody else, then why bother trying?  It's a problem that many philosophers have offered solutions too. In recent memory, Camus in his various writings points us toward rebellion as a means of challenging that absurdity. In so many words, he is suggesting we raise a big middle-finger to the universe, and yell in its face FUCK YOU! I WON'T DO WHAT YOU TELL ME!
Getting your head around how embracing the fundamentally absurd nature of existence is too much for most people. They stare at the abyss, and recoil. They turn back from the edge, and there's religion, waiting with it's confident manner, provisioning the fearful with warm, reassuring lies. It's ironic to see. In their minds, so many are freedom loving patriots, full of that American spirit, but at the moment where they are closest to actually crossing the threshold and embodying that spirit, they choose to abandon their last best chance at real freedom, and re-submit themselves to religion and its many authorities, because the truth scares them so much.
Because in their minds, leaving one's religion means abandoning their society, which means being alone, and for many, the fear of being alone is greater than their fear of dying.",28 points,2021-12-06T17:23:05+00:00,,,,,1,346,34.08,38.38,60.97,7.32,16.48,8.96,3.76,5.2,2.89,0.58,2.31,2.31,0,0,0.58,12.72,4.91,0.58,0,0.58,0.87,1.16,6.94,0,0,0,0.58,0.29,0,0.29,0,1.45,0.29,0,0.29,0,0.87,2.31,0.58,0,0,0.29,0,0,0,1.16,0.29,0,0.29,0,0.29,0,2.31,0.87,6.94,0.87,19.08,3.76,8.67,1.73,0.58,3.18,1.16,0

70,3487,Unique_Tour_7032,"I am a Lutheran pastor, and I agree with your insight here. I think part of the difficulty is that folks hear the dramatic healing stories in religious texts and, in response to those grand and obviously divine actions, adopt a limited understanding of what divine healing action can look like. Healing and other miracle stories are included in religious texts because they describe amazing one-off incidents, and they are meant to inspire hope in the reader rather than serve as a ""prescription"" or template for the divine action behind anyone's healing. 
Appreciation for these stories' literary function is frequently lacking in American Christian practice to the extent that, at least in my experience, people limit their understanding of divine healing to just grand, spectacular events. I am pretty sure that many people have died during this pandemic because they were waiting expectantly to become the subject of a healing story of biblical proportions instead of embracing the perspective that God can effect healing and good health through the work of people - in this case, through health care workers, vaccine developers/manufacturers, and public health workers. I got my vaccines and booster - and my church hosted vaccine clinics - because we believe that God works through the hands of others to care for our broken human bodies. We believe that God can heal in dramatic ways like the raising of Lazarus (John 11), but also that God heals - often in less grand ways - through the hands of caring people like the Good Samaritan who bandaged a stranger's wounds (Luke 10:25-37).",23 points,2021-12-06T18:50:59+00:00,,,,,1,260,83.98,58.38,26.23,94.96,37.14,8.08,6.92,1.15,2.31,2.31,0,0,0,0,0,12.69,5.38,1.54,0,0,0,3.08,7.31,0.38,0,0,0,0.77,0,0.77,0,6.54,0,0,2.31,0,4.23,9.23,7.69,1.92,3.08,0,0,0,0,0.38,0,0.38,0.38,0.77,0,0,1.54,1.54,4.23,0.77,13.85,2.69,4.23,0,0,1.15,5.77,0

I‚Äôm not exactly on the frontlines in GI medicine, so my opinion may not count for as much, but we have been triaging care for the past 18 months.  This is the definition of moral injury. A specific example was when a patient of mine died last year, it happened because his care got delayed because of covid restrictions.  And when I complained to my office manager that we can‚Äôt keep up the volume of double booking patient appointments (to catch up from last spring when elective procedures were cancelled, the hospital is now making us do double time) phone calls, etc she said to me ‚Äúwell, that‚Äôs the job‚Äù when we are short staffed and haven‚Äôt had adequate staffing for the past 3 years I have worked in this position.

Like, okay I understand that you didn't go to school to do housekeeping, but neither did I. Everybody has to do their part and help out. And yes, some programs are screwing their residents in other ways, but asking them to help the nursing staff is probably more beneficial than harmful and I honestly think that every med student should do a rotation in a nursing capacity.

Laika:
Laika was a Soviet space dog who became one of the first animals in space, and the first animal to orbit the Earth. Laika, a stray mongrel from the streets of Moscow, was selected to be the occupant of the Soviet spacecraft Sputnik 2 that was launched into low orbit on 3 November 1957. Wikipedia

Come help us, people. It‚Äôs depressing, but it‚Äôs not as depressing as some healthcare venues. It‚Äôs toward the top, though. The fact is that these people have to be well-cared-for simply based on the fact that they‚Äôre not allowed to die. We have to try and make the lives they‚Äôre forced to live at least somewhat fulfilling. I used to think what a dead end situation it was‚Äî no hope for release or recovery. What a pointless way to practice nursing. But guess what: permanent or temporary, we‚Äôre ALL in a dead-end situation having to make the most of what we‚Äôre given. When you look at it like that it makes a bit more sense.

80,3996,Longjumping_Song2088,"[If this is TLTR, scroll down to italics please!] I'm not a doctor, I'm a nurse. But my opinion from what I've seen is that most patients who come into the ICU with COVID-related body system failures generally have a few hours at most before they are intubated (and are generally sedated so they don't try to extubate themselves on purpose or accidentally). Once you're intubated, you're not talking. And if you haven't signed over power of attorney or have an advanced directive on file, then there's very little your family can say regarding your care except to pull the plug when hospital staff confirms you're not leaving the ICU alive no matter what. This happens thousands of times daily in this country, right before many of us nurses, over and over, watching senseless deaths happen with one person there to comfort them. The RN assigned to their care. Seeing this is on repeat for 2 years has been soul-crushing for us, as I'm sure you can imagine. As for an opioid/benzo combo, there are certainly palliative care teams within the hospital helping the family make decisions once it becomes apparent that recovery is unlikely, and medication measures that we use to help the patient through the dying process as painlessly as possible, ordered by the attending provider/physician. The times we see the air hunger is before intubation or when the body responds to treatment (this is random as f and not predictable as every patient is different and this virus is a sneaky mother trucker that will hunt down every way it can find to kill you) and the patients gets moved into a PCU (progressive care unit), which is a level of acute care just below the ICU. Sometimes patients are not sick enough for the ICU and go there first. These patients are still very sick and touch and go. A lot are not intubated, though, and they are desperately trying to get oxygen into their bodies with lungs that are being destroyed by the virus. Intubation isn't always the answer for every patient and it takes a lot more nursing care to manage an intubated patient. Frankly, a lot of hospitals are running out of nurses that are trained to manage intubated patients. If we were to give those patients, not on ventilators, opioids, there's a risk that we could depress the body's innate drive to breathe, a side effect of that class of drugs, thus making things worse. This is all a very long-winded way of me saying: for the love of all things good in the world, people, get vaccinated! Listen to real, reputable medical experts. Stop believing that any television program actually has all the answers, if any at all, and sometimes they're just plain wrong and only care about ratings. After two years gone by with hundreds of thousands dead, one year of millions of vaccinated people still alive and doing well, and nurses (and other hospital staff too) literally pulling their hair out, wanting to scream and cry and sleep all at once and bring you in to show you the devastation happening in hospitals that we must witness on the reg, (but we can't), please realize that it is more than just Okay to change your mind about things. It. Is. BRAVE! The only thing braver is to tell others about your change of thinking. America is certainly not ""the land of the free"" right now, contrary to what some think, but we could be again if only people would choose to be ""the home of the BRAVE"".

If you live in the county, the best thing you can do is call the phone numbers in the original post and reiterate OP's messages.  Especially if you vote for Judge McGinnis, you should make it clear that that's not happening again.
The relevant law is that the employees were hired ""at will"" which means they can resign or get fired with zero notice.  They gave notice anyway, just to be professional and not leave their patients in the lurch.  The legal thing for the hospital to do at that point would have been to counter-offer.
Instead they decided to file a garbage lawsuit asking the court to order Ascension (new hospital) not to schedule the nurses they just hired.
Thedacare isn't even asking the court to order the nurses back to Thedacare.  They just want the nurses not to go to their new jobs.
If you're wondering how this case wasn't tossed out, the answer is that the judge is a terrible person.

So, in the Fox Valley if you‚Äôre talking regular hospital type needs, you have a choice. However, ThedaClark is the nearby level 2 trauma center. It‚Äôs also the only branch of the Childrens Hospital in the area. It makes it really hard to avoid them if you have a real medical emergency or your kid needs a diagnosis for an ailment outside of your pediatricians wheelhouse. 
One time our daughter hadn‚Äôt pooped in a while and she just couldn‚Äôt. We took her to the ER, which took an X-Ray and thought she might have a twisted intestine (whatever it‚Äôs called) and they needed to do a barium enema with contrast. Well, the machine wasn‚Äôt working so they sent us to ThedaCare. Once there they couldn‚Äôt find anyone to do it on a 2 year old child. We then got whipped over to ThedaClark where they had a specialist do the procedure, she took a big dump and her guts were A-OK. (She poops like a champ these days, in case anyone was wondering.)

Only 3 RN's left that aren't travelers. Willing to pay $2550/week for a traveler, but only give staff RN's a snocone and 55 cent raise.
New CNO is under 40, hasn't worked a floor in near a decade, and caused 3 ER nurses and 1 floor nurse quit in the last month, but keeps it secret from the CEO.
CEO has a townhall meeting and tells all nurses, RT's, and the 2 CNA's that haven't left that we're a dime a dozen.
Can't hire regular staff because region is remote mountain desert with a cost of living 7% higher than national COL avg. Gas $4 in Texas type expensive.
I got sick and called out one day. I have an ADA protected disability. CNO texts me that, ""you know you won't get paid"", and follows with ""I just wanted you to know"". So, I resign and have filed with EEOC for ADA harassment/discrimination.

This past few weeks my friend's elderly mom needed to go to the ER (not COVID related and she's been vaxxed and boostered) and even though they said under normal circumstances she would be admitted immediately they sent her home 3 times with medicine before she was finally ""sick enough"" to be admitted where she then sat in  a hallway for hours on a gurney before they had to use her bed for a sicker patient so they had to transfer her, but there were no ambulances for several hours.
Finally after all day in the hallway they found transport to a hospital with a room 200+ miles away. At least they found her a room.
Plus, over on the Herman Cain award thread, most of the recipients complain about not having anywhere to go and waiting in the halls or whatever for days until they find a place. 
People from the outside see empty parking lots, empty beds, empty rooms and think everything is fine, when in reality you can have a million beds, but if you only have 3 HCWs there's not much you can do.
I'm sorry you are dealing with this. I was set to go back to nursing school in fall 2020 (I had to stay home because my kids schools closed for more than a year, and are still at the mercy of school case numbers) and after reading here and hearing from my friends I'm kind of glad I postponed it and I will probably go into a different field now.

People don't even realize how dangerous it is or why it means that if a hospital is at capacity with covid patients that they can't do things like heart surgeries so they just get mad because they think y'all are just neglecting everyone who doesn't have covid, and many think you're doing that because covid brings in so much money.

87,4305,Anonymous,"I‚Äôve really interrogated for 2 years now what common thread(s) exists among such a diverse group as antivaxxers, because they really are diverse; some are just much louder than others. I do have a degree in cultural anthropology so it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve always been interested in - human nature in groups, and especially in crisis.
The most salient thread to me is simply an unwillingness to believe what they wish was not true. It goes beyond politics, class, race, geography, education, profession, etc. Being antivaxx is really about rejecting reality and substituting their own. It‚Äôs the only way they can all dismiss the clear and legitimate evidence of COVID. They all undergo that process of selective belief, albeit through diverse rationales and justifications. 
I frequent the controversial sub that gives out awards, and what I‚Äôve noticed is that each and every meme shared is an attempt to self-soothe and/or construct an alternate reality. They‚Äôre all arguments for why the nominee/awardee shouldn‚Äôt be afraid. It‚Äôs a process of collecting subtle cues and flawed argumentation to defend fearlessness in rejection of their own creeping, subconscious terror. And then, when they get to the hospital, the religiosity is the last-ditch attempt to mentally avoid the permanence of their impending death. They speak of heaven like it‚Äôs a do-over for their mistakes, because they want to believe it is.
And this is a common human flaw that all of us have faced in our lives. 
(Edit: now that I think of it, this was basically the selling point of The Secret and all that manifestation crap: you have the power to create the reality you want with your mind. You can will desirable outcomes into existence. Fucking terrifying, truly.) 
I now have (basically former at this point) friends who are fully vaxxed but anti-mask making similarly flawed and ignorant arguments in service of their personal desire to stop masking. They intentionally ignore sources of information they don‚Äôt want to see, allowing them to feel validated in their recklessness. It‚Äôs scary to think how much damage such an easy and common thought process can do. But it‚Äôs also a reminder to notice when you‚Äôre letting yourself take the mentally convenient path, and nip that shit in the bud.

I think it was already leaning that way, then the hippies came here with their ""do everything an alternative way"" lifestyle in the 70s/80s and that really set the state up for having a culture of being against them. It's so weird that I call them ""conservative liberals""

One of the smartest members of our cohort when we were in nursing school was this Korean guy who worked as EMS. He is an ER nurse now. 90% of his social media feed on instagram is about how they engineered coronavirus in Wuhan lab and billionaires like Bill Gates, Elon Musk, etc are using it to wipe out the population to fix overpopulation issues.
