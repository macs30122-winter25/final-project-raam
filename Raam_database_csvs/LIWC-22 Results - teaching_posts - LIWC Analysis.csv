To the 2 or 3 people who carry their class on their backs both socially and academically, thank you for making me want to die just a little bit less each period I have you.

And I'd be faced with stony silence, so I'd move on with my lecture or whatever. Recently I figured out a technique that works great for forcing student engagement in lots of circumstances, and realized it would work for this simple question.
At the beginning of class I say, ""Take out a piece of paper. Write down one thing that you found confusing or unclear about the reading. If you totally understood it, write down one follow-up question or something you'd like to further understand. Don't hand them in. I will be calling on you randomly so write something down."" Then after a minute or so I just say, ""Ok before I start calling on people, who has a question they want to read?"" And TA-DA!!! Tons of questions about the material.  Good ones, that had me answering questions for most of the class rather than just lecturing at the class.

16,2020-11-02T23:08:31+00:00,belladisordine,Parents - you're failing your kids by preventing them from failing,"Pardon the rant. I'm over it.
I am irritated that parents aren‚Äôt letting their kids fail. I don‚Äôt have kids, but I was a kid whose mom let me fail, and miraculously, I learned from it and never made that mistake again. It was in 7th grade, the grade I currently teach. I waited until literally the night before our science fair project was due to begin it. My mom did not help. My mom did not write email after email to my teacher making excuses, begging for more time, and spinning a sob story of how hard I tried. No, my mom let me fail. I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúfail.‚Äù I probably earned a C, but for a student who typically earned As, it was a failure to me. While I may have procrastinated a few times after, it was never to the extent of what happened with that science fair project. Parents: You are failing your child by not letting them fail. One ‚ÄúC‚Äù in middle school isn‚Äôt the end of the world, and it‚Äôs much better to earn that C in middle school rather than in high school where the GPA counts more heavily. GPA isn‚Äôt really a thing in middle school until 8th grade. Your child should not have waited until the DAY BEFORE THE EXTRA CREDIT was due to begin it. Your child should know how to check and read his emails. Your child should know that he will not get credit for plagiarizing his assignment. Your child would have those horrible feelings of failure and disappointment to motivate him not to make those mistakes again if you hadn‚Äôt sent me a barrage of emails, if your husband, a 35-year veteran teacher who apparently has no clue what plagiarism is, hadn‚Äôt sent me emails, and if administration hadn‚Äôt stepped in to force my hand to offer your precious baby a second chance on extra credit. In the future, just tell me what grade you want your kid to have. It will save both of us time and frustration.",512,5 comments,https://old.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/jmyl6e/parents_youre_failing_your_kids_by_preventing/,0.142,0.752,0.106,-0.9214,1,351,24.55,46.8,78.71,5.87,16.71,4.56,1.42,3.13,1.14,0,1.14,0,0.57,0.57,0,18.23,4.84,0.28,0.28,0.28,0.85,2.56,13.39,2.56,0,1.14,1.42,1.42,0,0,1.42,8.55,0,0,7.41,1.14,0,0.28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.28,0.28,1.14,0.57,0.57,0,7.69,6.55,3.7,1.14,15.67,5.98,4.56,0,0,3.13,1.99,0
17,2021-10-16T04:46:52+00:00,FFF564,"I Almost Quit, but Decided to Just Teach","I went into this school year ready for anything. That ""anything"" didn't include 95% of what hit me like a freight train in just my first week. The kids that got dropped in my lap this year were beyond anything I ever expected. 
On day 1, I had a student (5th Grade ELA) stand on his desk and beat on his chest while screaming absolute nonsense. It wasn't even words. It was just guttural noise. This student proceeded to jump down and crawl on the floor across my classroom. All I could do was stand there and think ""What the absolute fuck is happening?"". This same phrase has now become a constant in my mind.
I spent my first entire month crying after work on my drive home. Between the kids, constant crazy expectations, PD days everytime I turned around, and the ""can you help out with this or that"", I was dying. I seriously went to my doctor and asked him to please give whatever drugs, even experimental, you can to just help me handle all of this. *He didn't do that, but did adjust some of meds to help with my anxiety. 
My biggest problem was that I wanted to teach, but felt like I was being pulled in some many different directions that I wasn't even allowed to do my actual job. The night before I was about to put in my 2 week notice, it hit me. They aren't going to fire me for not complying to half of the shit that they are wanting me to do. I'm ready to quit, so being fired, isn't too much different (I know recommendations are needed on a resume, of course). 
I decided to teach, really teach. If our district office came by to look at my data wall, I was already prepared to tell them "" Dat a Wall ain't a happening"". I broke all of the stupid rules. I never had my students open their textbooks that I hated. I read 2 different novels and did activities with those novels that the kids loved. I refused meetings that weren't beneficial or related to my actual planning during my planning period. I also quit working, grading, or planning after school. My room or lessons aren't Pinterest perfect anymore, but that's okay.
I was constantly second guessing my new approach, but I was happier. My students were also generally doing better. They were and are still crazy, but we've all developed a relationship in which we are able to manage it. 
So, did this work? As in, did my mandatory 9 week benchmark tests satisfy those above me? Did my craziness with the intention of doing what I felt was best for my students actually work? It actually did!!!! My 5th graders performed on their 9 weeks benchmark test higher than my class the year before. Their overall proficiency was higher than their beginning of the year benchmark and state test from last school year. 81% of all of my students passed that damn test too. My 5th graders also scored 15% higher on all aspects of the test compared to the rest of the district. 
TLDR: I said fuck the crazy expectations and just focused on teaching even if it meant getting fired, because I was already ready to quit. I ended up having a group that performed better than they ever have on our stupid benchmark tests.",492,5 comments,https://old.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/q953tz/i_almost_quit_but_decided_to_just_teach/,0.123,0.769,0.108,-0.9267,1,578,24.22,1.63,98.68,27.07,15.21,5.88,2.6,2.08,1.38,0.35,0.52,0.17,0.17,0.17,0.69,8.82,3.63,0.69,0.17,0.17,0,1.21,5.19,0,0,0,0.69,0.17,0,0,0.17,8.13,0.52,0.35,7.09,0.17,0,0.69,0.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.17,0.17,0.35,0.35,0,0.17,0,6.57,9.34,2.77,2.77,16.44,5.88,4.15,0.69,0.69,2.08,2.94,0

Yesterday a student forgot her Chromebook. She said she left it at her friend's house. Her friend, as in a girl in a different cohort, who comes to school on different days, so we can REDUCE the amount of students in contact with each other. 
I talked to my students about their weekend plans and noticed a pattern: sleepovers, birthday parties, soccer games, hockey practice, etc. 
It just makes me wonder WHY are we busting our asses at the school level to keep kids apart when they spend their days off together? Teachers in my building are lambasted for not being able to keep kids 6ft apart during mask breaks or transition time, but NOBODY seems to care about what kids are doing outside of school. It's just so incredibly frustrating, especially when you know that as soon as our cases go up, the school will take the blame, even if Billy caught COVID from his teammate on a Saturday.

Switching to online teaching is a bit like being a chef at a fancy restaurant that flooded. Now I cook from a food truck, but my community expects the same dining experience.
Normally, I carefully pick herbs and vegetables from the garden (that I grow myself), buy protein from various farms, and order in special items. I spent all year creating my menu and ordering all the food, but I had to throw out half of it because I can‚Äôt prepare it the same way in my food truck.
I cook meals for 125 kids a day, 5 days a week. I set the table with dishes and cutlery that I carefully polish, and bring in my own flowers, candles, and tablecloths to make it a welcoming dining experience. I invite all of my kids (and even parents) to dine at my restaurant.
44 diners do not show up, even though they said they would come. I can see them walking by the restaurant, but despite asking them repeatedly to come in and eat for free, they don't want to. I phone, email, text, and video conference with them and their parents, but it's like they've completely vanished.
11 claim they don‚Äôt know where the restaurant is, despite dining here the whole year. I email them a map. They arrive. They claim they don‚Äôt know how to eat lobster. I show them how. Their parents phone and want instructions on how to eat lobster. I also show them how with instructions, a video, and several books on the subject. The kid decides they don‚Äôt like lobster, even though they haven‚Äôt taken a single bite. I offer them a different dish. They leave. Their parents complain that I didn‚Äôt feed them. They leave after the first week.
12 complain about the food selection, even though I have carefully adapted my menu to serve vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian, paleo, low-sodium, low-carb, gluten-free, and check for allergens for each kid. I went to several meetings and courses to learn how to make these dishes. Their parents complain because I didn‚Äôt have a keto plate. Two parents thanks me for the support with their kid's low-sodium meals. They leave the restaurant after two weeks, but I still have to call and see if they want to come and eat. I feel like an annoying telemarketer, they don‚Äôt even pick up the phone now.
10 want me to cut up their steak into little bites and then spoon-feed them their meal. They ask every night for this, even though I've been working all year to try and get them to eat on their own. I can't serve other kids because I get tied up trying to feed so many individuals. Sometimes I will get lucky and can get a waiter to help me cut up the food, but with budget cuts, my restaurant can't afford that many waiters. I wonder why their parents haven‚Äôt taught them how to use utensils yet, but quickly find out that their parents have been cutting their food for them their whole lives. They leave after the third week.
5 kids show up at 5pm, 9pm, 3am, and on weekends and want me to feed them, despite having my hours posted and well-communicated. I still feel bad for not feeding them.
8 kids want me to deliver the food to them. It‚Äôs a bit more work, but I have no problems doing it. I adapt my menu so they get hot food, and I even use my own plates. When the waiters deliver the food now, they won‚Äôt answer the door. I never get my plates back.
7 kids leave their food virtually untouched, only picking out the pieces they like and leaving the rest. Their parents want to know what their kid ate every day, even though they could simply ask their kid. Or check their dining app. Or their emails.
12 kids show up when their parents force them, pretend to eat the food, but actually dump their plate into the trash can when their parents aren't looking. I ask them if they want another plate, but they don't respond. They show their parents the empty plate, and parents are too busy to notice. I don't blame the parents because I know they're stressed and overworked, but I still worry about their kids.
16 kids show up on time, eat the food, and even say thank-you. They fill my heart so full I could cry. I want to hug their parents. I am so thankful for these students because they remind me why I chose to become a chef for a living. It's not a job, it's a career and a large part of my identity.
Running the food truck is exhausting, but the relaxed dress code is a perk. I‚Äôm lucky because I don‚Äôt have my own kids to feed and nurture, on top of running the restaurant. I don‚Äôt know how those chefs do it. I hope I can go back to my restaurant, but with the flooding, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll have a job there in the fall. I wonder if all chefs feel this way.

One of the interesting things I did not expect from remote teaching: students private message me (in Zoom) way more than I imagined. They say good morning, they provide answers and feedback to discussions, and most surprisingly, they share very personal details about their lives.  The medium of texting/messaging seems more comfortable to them as a means to reach out and share their thoughts and feelings.

It's such a lovely way to start the day, you guys. It seems to help them get into the learning mindset first thing - cursive is a very grown-up skill, and progress is easy for them to discern. Plus, not only do the kids love learning it, I've had at least a half dozen parents thank me for teaching it.

34,2021-05-10T19:25:25+00:00,ArchStanton75,No more PD from speakers who abandoned the classroom,"Apologies in advance for this rant... My district recently had a PD session addressing the issue of burnout--good for them for recognizing the problem--but the speaker was condescending and awful. I won't name them or their program. They started off talking about how stressful their four or five years in the classroom were. Then during a cry in the parking lot they apparently had this wild revelation about needing to feel burned-in instead of burnt-out. They left the classroom and opted for the PD circuit instead.
Coming at the end of a school year where my school had four different schedules and all of us felt like first-year teachers again, the PD speaker's presentation felt downright insulting. They haven't been in the classroom for at least four years. They didn't experience spring 2020. They haven't seen any of the stress and horror we've seen this year. To be blunt, the speaker couldn't hack it in a regular classroom and decided to make themselves feel good telling other professionals how to do a job they couldn't handle for themselves. I had a student teacher last semester. I would rather listen to an eight-hour presentation from her than five minutes from the burnt-in speaker because at least my former student teacher understands what we've gone through this year. 
This is not to say that any PD speaker who left the classroom shouldn't speak to teachers. There are some phenomenal people out there who have earned the right to tell us how to improve. Manny Scott, in particular, is an absolute inspiration. I love him and his books. 
On the PD evaluation, I and my PLC wrote we would walk out if administration ever invited that speaker back again. After all we've been through, administrators must be more careful in who they select to come see us and tell us how to improve in our jobs. They have to get people who understand what the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 years have been like for us. The PD speaker circuit is filled with people who abandoned their classrooms a long time ago and wouldn't last a week in today's classrooms.

This is for my 9th graders: Every week my class is the same. We were told parents don‚Äôt want their kids in front of the screen for 8 hours a day, cool, I get that. I give maybe 30 minutes worth if work. I tell the kids after explaining the assignment, or just giving them the fucking answers, ‚ÄúHey! If you think you‚Äôve got it you‚Äôre free to log off the Zoom call and get your independent work done. If you have questions, or think you might need help stay and I‚Äôll be more than happy to answer them!‚Äù Then I sit in an empty Zoom call for 30 minutes. 
So I have 63 students either failing or in danger of failing. Parents emailing me ‚ÄúLittle Johnny/Suzy has NEVER had bad grades before! I don‚Äôt understand why they‚Äôre having a hard time in your class! They did all their late work but YOU never graded it.‚Äù Yo, did your student email me to tell me they turned it in? I don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs turned in late unless they tell me. I require students to advocate for themselves. Do they work on it during class time and ask me questions if they don‚Äôt understand? Closed mouths don‚Äôt get fed. Are they doing their Journal? I‚Äôve told them on multiple occasions it‚Äôs worth 25% of their grade. Oh they can‚Äôt do APEX? It‚Äôs credit recovery and I go over the daily section. It‚Äôs made to be done WITHOUT a teacher at all. I still go over the concepts with them. Again, did they ask any questions? Did they email me any questions? 
Yes, I understand this is a hard time for everyone. I‚Äôm not going to pass your kid because they showed up to the Zoom call. I‚Äôm going to pass them if they get work done. It‚Äôs about 1/2 of the work we do in person. When we started the directive was ‚ÄúTreat this like as normal as possible. That‚Äôs what everyone wants.‚Äù and now it‚Äôs ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre all failing, get their grades up!‚Äù 
Yooo, look. My class is already easy as fuck, these kids are literally going all over the state (Zoom calling from stores, hair appointments, the car on their way to a family get together), and it‚Äôs my fault their failing? Nah, teach your kids to take responsibility for themselves.

Situationally (is that a word?), I don‚Äôt make other staff stay past contract hours for an IEP. I will not schedule an IEP outside of those hours.

Fast forward to early October and we were blindsided with HR telling us we would now have to re-apply every 6 weeks to see if they could continue our accommodations.

With that, we‚Äôre also putting a ton of trust in parents and kids who a lot of times could not care less about us and our well being. 
Today, a student showed up with a doctor‚Äôs note after missing 3 of the last 4 days of school. Ok, no biggie. She said she had allergies. Fair enough. Until I started to dig deeper. I asked this student if they had any other symptoms last week, and low and behold they had a fever, body aches, stomach issues, and a constant cough. She was still coughing frequently today. I asked her if she was tested for covid, and she said, very quickly, ‚Äúno.‚Äù
That did not make me happy to hear in any sense so I called the school nurse and spoke with the principal as well. The local health department told us that she was in the clear because she had a doctor‚Äôs note from within the last five days, UNLESS she complains about not feeling well. So after hearing this, I mentioned to the student that I would like for her to let me know if she‚Äôs not feeling well at all today. Her response was ‚Äúbut my parents told me not to saying anything‚Äù and ‚Äúthey‚Äôll be mad if I have to go home.‚Äù
Sure enough, an hour later she told me she was not feeling well (and it was legitimate, she looked miserable). 
The point is, there truly are people who don‚Äôt give a shit about teachers or their families. I have people that I go home to that I love very much. I don‚Äôt want them getting sick. I feel awful for the kid to have parents teaching her such shit morals.

So I need to have lessons which are possible to do at home as well as in class.  Which means that all of my students are working on their little school-issued laptops through my entire class - and all of their other classes.  Their desks are separated so they can barely talk to each other (no complaining about that!).  What's the point of having in person learning if they're just staring at their screen the whole time?
I know that lots of parents are mad that they want in person learning, and I know that schools are trying their best to tailor to all students in class and at home... but in terms of risk:reward, it seems like we're risking our health/lives (not a huge risk, but a risk nonetheless) so that students can sit in school and do work on their laptops instead of sitting at home and work on their laptops... there's zero reward for doing this.  They might as well stay home.

73,2020-04-27T21:22:20+00:00,theyellowsalamander,Lockdown is showing us what people really think the role of a school is,"With social services stretched beyond limits, youth services non existence and community services cut beyond recognition, every discussion about schools reopening focuses on childcare, free school meals, child abuse... not children‚Äôs learning. My school has counsellors, a physiotherapist, a nurse, a police officer. Our pastoral team have organised food banks, collections of clothing and essentials, pressured landlords, sorted benefit claims.  The children‚Äôs access to these services have been discussed so much more than the academic progress of the pupils this month. Parents/politicians/non-educators are not at all concerned about the literacy / numeracy level of the children dropping (some could argue lock down has made parents critical of large parts of the academic side of school) but everyone wants the social services provided by the school back.
I‚Äôm not saying whether this new role of the school is a problem or not, it‚Äôs certainly a massive topic. But maybe it‚Äôs time to admit that social care is a major role of schools and start allocating the funding, training and resources with this in mind? Even having a school‚Äôs social support mentioned in their rankings/reviews/inspections would be a start.
I‚Äôm a new teacher, would love to hear some thought?
