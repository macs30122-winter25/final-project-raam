3,133,jenziyo,"Yes! I could go on for literally ever.
1. Start by connecting with a few kids outside of the lesson- this might be after class, if they finish an assignment early, etc. Ask about an interest and let them teach you about it. Seek it out on your own time and tell them what you’re learning about it and begin a convo, maybe including more kids. It’ll show you’re a learner, interested in learning from them, and in them. It goes a long way and kids see this who are not necessarily involved in the initial convo.

Learn about their families- it’s amazing the struggles these kids have that are both extraordinary and ordinary. Most often kids aren’t listened to at home and are used to being ignored, so when asked how they’re doing it’s strange many times. Ask questions that offer an option to share their experiences and connect with peers by offering low-stakes options to respond. Instead of “how are you?” (a personal question to a whole group is hard) maybe say, “I had the weirdest dream I was being chased by a clown last night and couldn’t go back to sleep. Anyone else ever have crazy dream like that?” 
Set a foundation for respect by a) never addressing an individual’s misbehavior in front of the group - take them outside, b) always giving benefit of the doubt until a pattern emerges, then call attention to the pattern as a teachable moment, c) think aloud through your social-emotional decisions. If you’re frustrated by their lack of a response to a question you’re posing to connect with them, tell them “hey guys, I’m asking you this question because I care about how you’re feeling. It don’t feel valued when I ask and no one speaks. What can we do instead of speaking to answer the question?” (This is a high-level convo, maybe 10th grade one.)
As a SEL warm up, ask them to share out something on a piece of paper anonymously, then read the (appropriate) papers aloud- great community-building exercise.
Usually being respectful of their personal struggles sets all the stage you need (don’t you remember adolescence?! The struggle is very real for them - even though we know there’s life after teens, they don’t👹). Maintain high expectations but help them get there by teaching them to manage themselves to get there- this is more than content. In fact, 90% of what they learn in your class is just how to deal, the content is just the vehicle. Be clear of your expectations and do a lot of reflection on those goals and what behaviors are contributing to or hindering their getting there.

Like I said I could really go on forever,  but I’ll try to end with this: in 13 years I’ve never met a kid who is bad in their heart. The worst behaved or most checked out are the most in need of compassion, understanding, and someone to show them how to be productive desultory despite their emotions (when possible- relationships with counselors and families is so important to this point too).
Ask how they are tomorrow and if you don’t get a response, you can say “I am struggling with this current climate now too. [Insert way you’re struggling if you feel comfortable.] I am going to try to make sharing here more comfortable and we’ll work on it. I understand it can be tough sometimes to open up in school, but let’s work on this together.” Resume your lesson and try a different opening SEL activity the next day.",9 points,2020-10-29T00:25:02+00:00,0.059,0.834,0.107,0.9841,1,594,39.11,84.53,74.32,34.44,18.56,4.38,2.53,1.52,1.18,0.51,0.34,0,0.17,0,0,21.04,8.59,1.01,0.17,0.17,0.17,4.38,11.78,0.34,0,0,0.17,0,0,0,0,2.86,0,0.17,2.69,0,0,0.34,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.67,0,0.84,0.67,0,0,5.72,1.85,7.41,1.52,19.36,4.55,3.87,0.67,0.34,3.87,6.06,0.17

5,206,NerdyOutdoors,"I feel like tiktok and clash of clans or whatever mobile games are another symptom, not the disease.
And the disease is somewhat outside our control—schools and teachers have experienced “mission creep” where many are expected to take on roles of social/emotional counselor, teacher, provider of moral guidance, multiple meal provider, and even laundry facility.  The safety and security nets around students are fraying— fams work multiple jobs, fams face food insecurity or can’t do laundry or are negligent.  And schools remain the one civic institution where it’s convenient to catch, and attempt to help, students.  So teachers are addressing problems that aren’t handled at the house: “put your phone away. Have some manners. Make eye contact. Respect authority. Eat dinner! Have a good breakfast!  Here’s a hug and some love! Do your chores.” Etc etc.  
Couple this with, as someone said, the deliberately built algorithms and gamified badges and rewards— social media exists mostly to commodify the user; the kids and their attention ARE the product; gotta serve up them ads—
And it’s just a tiring battle.

They each get an index card, they all write down a question about something they didn't understand (we're doing ancient texts right now, like Gilgamesh, so there's a lot). 
Throw them into some heterogeneous groups of four. 
Pass the index card clockwise. If you can answer it, write the answer on the back. If you can't then pass it on. 
Any questions that were unable to be answered by the group as a whole get talked about with the entire class. I make a mental note about the good, thought-provoking questions that I saw as I paced the room and we discuss it even if it was answered. 
From there we take those questions and develop them into some work on themes/character development or whatever we're doing that day.

With PollEverywhere, it's a different environment and so it comes without those connotations, and I usually just use it to gather questions or to conduct a poll at the beginning of class that will affect the way we talk about the topic for the day.",2 points,2019-09-02T16:33:20+00:00,0.008,0.948,0.044,0.8381,1,269,48.36,62.12,58.68,36.11,44.83,1.12,1.12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.87,4.46,0,0,0,0,3.72,10.41,0.37,0,3.35,0.37,0,0,0,0,9.29,0.74,0,8.55,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.12,0.74,0,0,4.83,3.35,5.2,1.49,11.52,2.23,5.2,0,0,1.86,2.23,0

First of all, your classroom just became more inclusive for people who have processing disabilities and for people who speak english as a second language.  Both may need more time to formulate their thoughts.  Secondly, many people have varying degrees of busy schedules and some ppl can switch gears more easily.  But for those who may being going thru highly stressful times (financially, emotionally, etc), you just gave them some calm and space to think.  Third, the fact u r calling on them doesnt seem like an ambush anymore.  Not that it ever was, but it can feel this way.

I'm going to start my student teaching this Fall (luckily the first semester is online so Covid isn't an issue for that... yet) and it's amazing how many people in my classes or in Facebook groups or even here who are genuinely shocked that there are so many teachers that don't like their jobs. There are so many who think of teaching through rose colored glasses that may just hear about low salary or something. I think that before going into teaching we should know some of the bad stuff that we'll be up against. That way we can make an educated decision before spending thousands of dollars to enter the field.
That said, of course, there's a line where it's just flat out whining and doesn't do anyone any good. But I know, I for one, have seen those posts over the years and use it as a window into what teaching is really like so I can gauge (as well as you can without first hand experience) whether or not I can deal with some of the shenanigans. As I've been in retail for most of my adult life (I'm in my late 30s) I feel I can handle it as well as anyone else, but there are definitely some who see it and realize it's not primarily sunshine and roses and can get out before it's too late.
Anywho. Just another perspective. :D

I just feel like if a young adult (college age or so) spoke to a respected adult this way it would come across as extremely condescending.  I’ve noticed adults / educators praising children for being “well spoken” and even going so far as to encourage them to become public speakers for a living (or similar comments regarding art, whatever subject, etc.) but then —when they become older—unless they’re the best of the best all of a sudden they are discouraged from following their dreams; told they are too confident and unrealistic.  These “gifted” children go from feeling like they have so much potential to feeling like they don’t know how to fit into the box society wants to shove them into... and they often ARE overly cocky due to years and years of exaggerated praise.

His/her partner holes strings at the north pole. We mention the strings hang so long from his or her head. LONGitude.  
We talk about measurements for clothes chest stomach hips... and how these are parallels and never meet.  We then measure the latitude lines. I also say Latitude, flatitude, fatitude.  
We then repeat longitude lines are drawn vertical from the poles. So the lines are DRAWN up down BUT measure distances east and west. 
Reverse for parallels.  
I do not define or give the history of meridians, its astronomical roots, other than modern day arbitrary and Greenwich won (more or less). 
Finally, the kids divide into groups and act out latitude and longitude.

17,673,sticklebat,"This is why we also need to be able to remove teachers (and, IMO, get rid of or substantially weaken tenure). I adopt a similar attitude as OP, my students and their parents are happy, they do well on their tests, and as a result my administration likes me despite the fact that I break or ignore all sorts of rules and standards. 
The thing is, I've seen plenty of veteran teachers stop caring too much. They stop doing or half ass genuinely important things, their students don't get the support they need, etc. But as things are now (at least in my district), tenure is so strong that a teacher would basically have to physically abuse a student to be fired. Attempting to deal with those teachers has resulted in a lot of bullshit rules and bureaucracy to make it a little bit easier to reprimand and eventually make a case for removing them. But to teachers already doing their job it's all just a drain and a waste of time. Like I said, I mostly just don't do all that crap and my administration leaves me alone, but at the cost of weakening their case if they do try to get rid someone (if a teacher can prove that a rule is being selectively enforced then it can't be used against them). 
TL;DR Teachers should be given a greater degree of professional freedom and we shouldn't be expected to dedicate our time outside of regular work hours to school. But if that's to work, administrations need to be able to actually get rid of ineffective teachers. A lot of that bureaucratic nonsense is specifically designed to keep bad or checked out teachers accountable given our extreme degree of job security.

I’m also leaving work at work, teaching to my work hours and focusing on self care. I took a Friday or two off, make some days “quiet independent work” days and focus on connections with kids. I’m happy. I love my job. I’m not burned out, stressed or yelling at kids or other teachers.

If that means submitting fake data (pertaining to all the extra assessments admin asks for during PLC, RTI, Read by 3,etc), then so be it.  My team lead (1st gr), took pity on me, because I’ve always been that teacher that puts the job above my health. However, she is the opposite, and has much more work/home life balance.  Basically, she told me admin has to answer to their district bosses, and those are the ppl who sit in their offices, trying to justify their jobs by creating more work for teachers.  In a nutshell, she tells  me she’s been submitting phony data (that shows continued weekly ‘progress’).  She even submits phony RTI progress monitoring scores, and instead she uses her own assessment tools to track progress once a month.  After ruminating on all this, I think this may be a way to survive the crazy.  Admin is never going to pull back on piling more on our plates, and I just want to teach again without worrying about giving them their precious data every week.",0 points,2021-10-17T01:49:57+00:00,0.064,0.847,0.089,0.7391,1,197,40.3,64.08,54.77,2.76,21.89,4.06,0.51,3.05,1.52,0,0.51,0.51,0,0,0,15.74,4.57,0.51,0,0,1.52,2.03,11.17,0,0,3.55,0,0,0,0,0,5.58,0,0.51,5.08,0,0,1.52,1.52,0,0,1.02,0,0,0,0,1.52,0.51,0.51,0,0.51,0,7.11,2.54,5.58,2.54,19.29,4.57,8.12,0,0,1.52,5.08,0

18,744,TheRealCanadianGoose,"Unfortunately, this is not the case for all of my peers. The average age of those in my program is late 20s early 30s, many of them with children and many of them now in significantly debt both from school and not working in covid. Because of when covid hit many will not have sufficient field reference to get a teaching job. Furthermore, many also lost their jobs they maintained while in school due to layoffs and health concerns.
While I am on the younger side I am now starting my career late which means I will be dealing with the impact of my teaching pension later in my life. Regarding your insurance comment many of my peers now are not insured at all. While I am a dependent on my parents insurance, it is significantly less then what I would receive as a teacher, which would have resulted in me not paying out of fully pocket for any treatment this year however now I will pay out of pocket this year all without having a stable job. The boards here are not hiring new teachers and are rather hiring from the sub list. Which I support in that many of them deserve those positions however this means thousands of new teachers are unemployed.
I agree I may have more freedom in my career options right now and can find work elsewhere. I disagree in that teachers with families are in a worse spot. A significant majority of jobs in my area are limited to part time minimum wage unless you have significant amount of experience in a specific field or an additional degree or training.

18,746,TheRealCanadianGoose,"Yup. Then add on the bonus of class size limits being lifted and it spirals even more (at least in the places I did field and in my towm). So either socially distanced or masked. 
Realistically in every middle/high school I've seen in my city, which is all of them, social distancing is not possible unless they cut class sizes down below 15 students. So that means masks all day. Adding how impractical it is to cohort high school students, hallway encounters, students who believe that it isn't that bad, teachers who believe covid isn't a big deal, inability to maintain that level of sanitation, teacher exhaustion from lack of breaks, insufficient supplys being provided, etc. I think this is going to spiral and our system will cause a second wave where I live. 
Add onto that what ATA were planning in November due to contact negotiations and it is just not going to be a good time as either they go through with it or push it off due to covid. As I am not currently a member I have no clue what they are doing but I don't see it going well. Either they go ahead and it loses it's impact or do it later and parents lose it as everything ""just went back to normal.""

Well that's the thing--can they? My school is still fully online, but I know other teachers who are back in-person, and from what I've heard, the idea that these kids are going to social distance of their own accord is a joke.

Board has vague plans to start phasing kids back by late October - early elementary and ""self-contained"" special ed first, then higher grades and students with less provided services.

Have heard this rhetoric too - I guess creating schedule books, gathering all the support materials a school provides for students ready to send home, prepping individualized ""how-to's"" for every single family on every single content area and life skill, info on how their kid is capable of learning, detailed instruction on what services we provide so they can hopefully mimic those services as best they can during a global pandemic while everyone is dealing with the social and emotional impacts on our own lives is ""nothing.""
Context - I'm not mad at you I'm mad at the system. 😓 Have had such a hard time keeping myself based in reality doing all that work and prep and then hearing from parents and general society that I've done ""nothing.""  I work in SpEd as support staff, Monday is supposed to be our official first day of ""remote."" Been involved in all-day virtual professional development the last two weeks. We've explicitly been told most of our families don't have technology access and may not until mid to late October. We start Monday but ""equipment pick up"" (for what we have managed to scrounge together) is Tuesday. 🤷 Distance learning in the Spring was already tough - had a percentage of kids that we just didn't hear from and attempts to follow-up weren't successful. Personally, it was really difficult to watch home-based support staff completely disregard education staples like learner autonomy, presumed competency, or even just wait time (so many shoulder pokes 😬 - ""your teacher asked you a question.""

My classroom is far from the office and I never have to go in there but that’s pretty frustrating to see. 
ALSO the main reason why I responded was because unfortunately a lot of teachers went MIA last spring so it might be an accountability thing.

Hemingwayapp - AWESOME for my ELA students. Keeps them from going on long run-on sentences.
Kahoot! - Such an awesome way to quiz materials in an interactive and fun way. 80% of my kids this year, before even getting to know me, asked me if I would do Kahoot!. Super popular with the kids.
Poll Everywhere - An awesome visual way to do quick polls, word clouds, and surveys. The results update with visual charts in real-time, so it's super fun and interesting if you can incorporate it into a lesson.
NewsELA - Allows you to assign and read many, many, many various articles on ALL sorts of topics. Super relevant stuff and they crank the articles out every week. You can adjust the reading difficulty from 4th grade up to 12th grade... and the article will change its complexity!

23,965,mufflepult,"I've only used Google Meet a bit, so I'd defer to your experience there, but my general sense is that it has the same fundamental problem of not being able to control what people see. Plus it sounds like it's missing breakout rooms, which is a bummer. The text chat is deprioritized in an annoying way, similar to in Zoom, though I believe there's one small perk which is that messages briefly show up as video overlays when you have text chat closed. So it would be harder for a teacher or student to be completely unaware of text chat. In general, I'd put it in the same category as Zoom--teleconferencing software that's ill-suited for the classroom, but not impossibly so.",3 points,2020-08-11T20:35:57+00:00,0.131,0.845,0.024,-0.925,1,122,21.32,5.4,84.75,20.23,24.4,1.64,0.82,0.82,0.82,0,0.82,0,0.82,0,0,11.48,7.38,0,0,0.82,0,5.74,4.1,0,0,0,0,1.64,0,0,1.64,3.28,0,0.82,2.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.64,2.46,6.56,0,17.21,4.1,5.74,0,0,4.92,2.46,0

So if you create a shared Google doc of the main class meeting link, and below it have links to Breakout Room 1, Breakout Room 2, etc. then you can have student click the links and have their own meetings. You can have each breakout room in a separate tab (be sure you can mute tabs - use an extension if needed) so you can click among the rooms. 
I created a document that has unique links for each class and breakout rooms that I will just reuse throughout the year.

Look at one or two of the essays. If they are as bad as you imagine them to be, give the students a chance to self-assess their work, as it’s the first essay of the year. Give them a small assignment where they can criticize their own work and outline what they need help with. If they don’t complete the assignment, it’s a 0. Also stress to the kids that the prep work is a necessary component of writing, and must be completed. 
If you are really struggling, you can try to reach out to another teacher in your dept. and see if they can help you grade. (Don’t try this if you know everyone else is struggling as well). I have helped stressed colleagues do some grading in the past, and it can be a great temporary relief for them.

It’s simply unfair how much time ELA teachers can spend grading. My content leader has been teaching since 1993 and demands we do two five-paragraph papers by the year’s end. Last year I had  132 students- I would take at least 5 minutes per student to grade written assignments, but it normally took about 10 if I put in any comments. That is 11 to 22 hours just to grade.

This year is fucking hard.
This is my 17th year teaching, and I’m teaching a K/1 combo remotely.   I am a great teacher, but teaching remotely is the hardest thing I have ever done.
It is so stressful. I’m anxious all the time.  I’m on technology for ten or more hours a day.   I hate that I can’t hug my littles every day.  I miss being sneezed and boogered on. I miss tying 20 shoes everyday.  I miss the authentic conversations we had that are impossible to duplicate on Zoom.  I miss building deep relationships with my kiddos.  I miss it all.
The thought that keeps me going every day, is knowing that we are stepping up for our students.   I’m watching some of my best friends teach in-person, and they are struggling, too.  We are perfectionists, and knowing my students will not leave me at the end of the year where they typically do is killing me.   We are not lowering the bar; it’s just a different bar.   No matter where you are teaching, we are all having the same struggles.
We are in the same storm.  We are in different boats, but doing our very best to weather this goddamn storm.

I teach them how to read the rubric, do guided self assessments, and peer grading with the rubrics. It’s a lot of time in class but I don’t get many D/F essays with this. I also do a day for revisions when I get them all graded and turned back. 
However, I grade them without mercy. They’ve had all the hand holding in the world and if they haven’t done the prep work for it, that’s on them.

They either don’t notice or don’t mind. The only exception to this would be big assignments like tests and projects. But I’ve been bundling tests - like each group of 4 takes the test together and also presents their project together so it’s 1/4 the work. 
Most of the kids are getting A’s anyways. Grading more or less work is unlikely to dramatically change their grade.
The biggest tip I ever learned in my first year of teaching was “you create your own workload” - overwhelmed? Throw the whole stack away. Or take a movie day and grade while they watch the movie.

The reason it sounds like this is because there are ALREADY dozens, hundreds, nay, thousands of useful videos of this nature. But cataloguing and analyzing them is time consuming work. Checking to make sure the humor is age appropriate means that you need to watch the whole thing first, then let the kid see it. Creating a basic level of checking for understanding means that YOU have to understand it first. This are skills that teachers have honed, and been paid to hone, for years.

Like I said I don’t remember the tech lingo, but that’s why I chose Meets of Zoom even with the loss of all the features, because at the very least the students can all hear me and can have another tab open without getting kicked off.

Especially having the separate time for office hours - for most students they continued not to attend, but my school has a senior capstone project in which every teacher mentors a couple seniors, and having time set aside for them was really useful. On the other hand, sometimes Wednesdays were brutal for teachers, with back to back heavy meetings all day long.
I would personally advocate for them to stay, but I think I'll be outvoted by teachers who felt the latter problem. Oh well! Maybe we can still get Wednesdays to turn into a half day or something?

Luckily we had enough band together to bring change. Our governor said schools could open as long as teachers and 6-12th graders wore masks. That was it. So we basically said - either enough of us retire/quit that you can’t open the school, or you implement such strict safety guidelines that the joy is stripped from school and virtual would be a better option. (And when I say “we” I should state that this was the statewide organizers, my urban district was one of the first to announce going virtual because that’s what the majority of our parents wanted.

We aren’t going face to face in my district for first three months due to pressure from the community, but our rural districts are still doing in person. It’s terrifying. The mayor in a rural town near us said they won’t be enforcing the mask mandate in businesses or schools because it’s “not my job or the cops, they have better things to do”. 
It’s also hard with lack of support from friends and family. Voicing that your nervous to go back to work is met with “just stop reading fake news, you’re scaring yourself! It’s all a hoax!” Some of my teacher friends have been dealing with this, and feeling very alone even at home. I’m very lucky to have an amazing support network, I can’t imagine the turmoil of being told your fears aren’t valid from people who are supposed to love you, while they’re bragging about going to Walmart every day without a mask. 
No one wants to be the reason their loved ones suddenly believe the virus is real. None of us want to become a statistic or a page in the yearbook.

Admin pumped this up as being an awesome training. Had I forgotten my past 8 years of pointless PD’s in the hope this would be different? Yes.
First of all they explain what dyslexia is and isn’t.  Good, awesome. I needed to learn more about that.
Then the suggestions for helping dyslexic students were basically to route them into specific classes.  The presenter specifically mentioned my subject area (French) as one that they should be discouraged from taking.  That seems... not right? Like I get that some classes will be easier for them to be successful in than others.  But to actively discourage them from pursuing a subject they want to learn??  My students with dyslexia are currently very successful in my class, I see no reason to turn them away.  Teachers of other courses that were mentioned as discouraged for students with dyslexia were pissed as well.

My district's professional development days are a joke. The same set of seminars, workshops, focus group, or \insert current buzzword here** have been rotated through for the past 4 years.

I think (my department at least) finally figured it out with presenting unique stuff and doing it all before lunch this time around.

I sat through 11 days of training over the past 8 months.  There were times that it really really felt like the state told the people who designed the modules how many hours they wanted the training to be, so the people designed it to take that much time.  There was so much filler.
To the credit of my presenters, they did a decent job of cutting it short when they could, and they almost never kept us until the scheduled end of the day, but it was still a huge waste of time for most of us.
Though, I will admit (hopefully without going too deep into /r/iamverysmart territory), that I'm frequently amazed at how slowly my colleagues pick up on things.  Sometimes I just look around and think ""Are you serious right now?""  So, perhaps some people need that much time to process and engage new material.

So, with regular printing, you get to lift the pencil after every letter, which allows you to lift your hand to reposition it, you also get to start and end the letter at at point that feels and flows the best. With cursive, you don’t get to do that, and end up having to lift your pencil mid-word, which throws off the flow of the writing. Letters have to begin on the left and end on the right, which causes lefties to do loops and such that aren’t supposed to be there because the motion is unnatural to them and right-handed teachers don’t have the ability to teach it correctly(by no fault of their own). I was ALWAYS in trouble for doing that because my right-handed teachers never understood.
Every letter ends to the right, and usually requires a smooth taper to transition to the next one, that’s really hard for a lefty. Try making a check mark with your left hand starting from the left side. It’s a simple motion, but it doesn’t look good when pushed vs pulled. You end up making a V instead of a check.
Also, the way you hold your pencil and paper is COMPLETELY different. I used to get in trouble for “proper posture” constantly. My teacher gave me a pencil grip that was supposed to help me hold my pencil correctly, but it didn’t work because it was made for right-handed people. I watched this happen again when I was in another teacher’s classroom 2 years ago. The student was holding the pencil correctly for a lefty, but because the teacher was right handed, they assume the student’s poor cursive was due to the way they held their pencil.
And, if you’re using a ball-point or rollerball pen, the metal around the ball just scratches so horribly. On bad enough paper(like the thin brown stuff some schools have) it’ll rip through no matter how softly you write.
Right-handed teachers don’t understand the struggle and don’t know how to help lefties because they are not left handed themselves, so they really need to be a bit more understanding if they’re going to force cursive on the kids. Lefties are super adaptable and learn how to do things their own way with the right guidance, and unless a teacher is going to let them, they shouldn’t force it upon them.",6 points,2021-02-25T18:23:53+00:00,0.062,0.872,0.066,0.0198,1,416,49.92,54.4,61.38,14.91,24.47,2.88,1.2,1.68,0.48,0.24,0.24,0,0,0,0,11.06,2.16,0.48,0,0.24,0,0.72,8.89,0,0,0,0.24,0,0,0,0,4.09,0,0,3.13,0.96,0,0.48,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.44,0,0.96,0.48,0.24,0,4.81,4.09,4.81,3.13,16.11,4.09,5.29,0,0,3.85,2.88,0

Plenty of licenses professionals – teachers included – do not do their job well, and how do you verify that the children are learning? Would you rather we're beholding to quantitative metrics like test scores instead of the subjective, but nonetheless more flexible and context sensitive, evaluations of administrators?

How do we know fire fighters are really putting out fires? How do we know dentists are filling cavities? Bankers are really depositing checks?

Because you can tell if a fire is put out or not. And if your dentist is shitty, you can simply go to a different one. And if your banker doesn't deposit your check, the bank is on the hook and the person will be held accountable for their negligence and be fired – or worse. None of those are remotely reasonable comparisons to teaching, which is a public service. You can't just switch teachers like you can switch dentists.

Because some teachers aren't trustworthy. I have worked with some who've been bad enough that they were fired before and in spite of tenure, and more who should have been fired but couldn't be because they were tenured 15 years ago and realized they could do almost nothing and the union would nonetheless protect them. In your model, how do you fire a teacher who is bad at their job? How do you demonstrate that they're bad? Who does the hiring and firing?
From the second part of your comment, what you're really saying is that you aren't fine with shitty administration who require pointless busy work from you and don't provide adequate supervision or support where it matters.

37,1594,sticklebat,"You are putting words in my mouth and I don’t appreciate it.

Can I ask why you find teachers so untrustworthy

I don’t find teachers, as a monolithic entity, untrustworthy. I find an unfortunate number of my colleagues, as individuals, untrustworthy. And I don’t think teachers are less trustworthy than others, but there are systems of accountability in place for almost every other profession, and pretending that teachers are so magical that we don’t need accountability is delusional.
They do the bare minimum needed in order to safely retain their jobs, and the only reason they even do that much is because if they do less, the administration will be able to fire them. And at least where I work, the minimum established by the union contract is woefully insufficient, IMO. 

If plenty of ""licensed professionals"" don't do good jobs, why would principals and admin be any better?

There are fewer of them, which means it is easier and more practical to hold them to high standards. I’m not arguing that all administration is good, but there are good admins out there and that should be the aspiration. Ultimately a school’s administration answers to the school’s community (in most cases, that’s not as true in very large districts), and so communities with a strong emphasis on education tend to have competent administrators. Also, there is value in having a consistent vision for a school, which you’re not going to get from a school run as a FFA by all its teachers. There are also decisions like: what courses should be taught? How should we spend our budget - on hiring more teachers? Expanding extracurriculars? Who hires and fired employees? At some point you just end up with administrators again.
I do agree with you that administrators pay is often excessive, and administrations are sometimes bloated. There are also plenty of bad administrations. All of those things are not good and I won’t defend them, no matter how hard you try to conflate those things with “administration” in general.

The idea that there is no inherent oversight or way to gauge success vs. failure for classroom teachers the way there is in fire departments (another public service, by the way), dentistry, etc. is absurd. None of these jobs are clear cut--fires aren't all the way contained, fillings eventually decay, clerical errors occur, etc.

Now you’re just being obtuse. An incompetent firefighter will be fired by their chief. They have a boss. An administrator, who can observe their work and judge their failures. Professional firefighters also go through rigorous training and exams that directly correlate to the skills and knowledge that they need to fight fires, which in itself is a fairly straightforward practice. If you have such confidence in teacher certification programs, and you think teaching is as straightforward as firefighting, then you and I went through very different experiences to get certified, and have very different standards for education. Also, your dentistry example is completely irrelevant. Dentistry is a private practice, and if you’re unsatisfied with your care, go find a new dentist (also a dentist proven to be negligent will lose their license to practice). Students can’t just go sit in a different classroom if their experience with a teacher is bad. A bad dentist will go out of business or be shut down because they’re bad. A bad teacher with no oversight will just continue to be a bad teacher.

How does admin tell whether a teacher is successful and deserving of praise or not successful and needing support? 

I can tell you how good admin does. They spend a lot of time observing new teachers. They have competent veteran teachers mentor them. They have weekly meetings with their new teachers and look over their assignments and assessments. They offer help when they see a need and ask if there’s any other supports that would help. And if the lessons they observe flop consistently, or the students regularly fail reasonable assessments, or there are tons of complaints from students and parents, then perhaps the teacher needs more help. And if the teacher demonstrates no desire to grow or improve, or the mentor expresses exasperation, then maybe that new teacher isn’t capable or isn’t a good fit. But someone has to make that determination. Who is that going to be, if not an administrator? Do we become like the police: “we have investigated ourselves and found nothing wrong.”? Because that sure works well...

How does a principal fire a 15 year tenured teacher now? 

That’s not a problem with admin. It’s a problem with unions and tenure. But my school actually has fired a couple long-tenured teachers recently. Admin observed them often enough that they were able to sufficiently demonstrate their incompetence that not even the union could save them. That’s certainly the exception rather than the rule, but my question still stands:  Do you agree that it should be possible to fire bad teachers? If no, then have a nice day, you’re crazy. If yes, how does that work without administration? Who decides to fire teachers?

What if all those ""untrustworthy"" teachers you've encountered were magically not in the profession, the way you are saying all bad admin would just magically not be in the profession?

That isn’t what I said at all. The ratio of administrators to teachers is (or should be) small. It is much easier to 1) find a small number of very competent people than a large number, and 2) to hold a small number of people to elevated standards than a large number of people. This is just practical. I am not saying that administrators are magically amazing at their job, nor that the country doesn’t have a problem with bloated or incompetent administrations. The system needs to be fixed, but the only magical thinking happening here is that if you leave teachers to their own devices with no oversight that they’ll do a better job.

38,1639,chargoggagog,"That thinking is unfortunately problematic.  Too many seasoned teachers have found the path to making things work in the short term. And they latch onto them because they appear to work that day.
Graphic organizers are a great example of a tool that looks like it works in practice, but in terms of actual transfer of learning they don’t work at all.  
Teachers want success now, and so some prefer to teach procedure over concept, rote memorization over flexible strategies.  The former can be done by one teacher in isolation and it works for that test.  But in terms of a school or the kids’ experience over time it does a disservice to the child’s learning.  The latter on the other hand supports a child’s learning over the long term.
This is why I argue strongly against student performance being directly linked to teacher pay or tenure.  Student performance over the long term isn’t determined by how well they can crank out addition problems, but instead by their number sense and how well they understand place value.  
The facts are seasoned teachers like us have a wild variety of opinions and practices.  None of them are acceptable as “the right way” because they are not based on research and science.

im with you all the way. I mainly teach middle school math at he moment, and shit hit the fan recently. We basically had 6 months of distance learning, with minor variations - students literally did nothing. I had students being put in my class at the beginning of the year ( i work in europe), that lacked fundamental knowledge of how to do stuff. They spent most of their time just slacking of and doing nothing at all. And now, they lack behind and are overwhelmed because they dont know the stuff required from them. To add to that, they struggle doing half the work they had to do before.
The admins here work under the overarching idea, that everything is the teachers fault. Kids failing? Teacher did not do his work properly. Forgot their homework? Ah, turn a blind eye to it. Too much stress? Nevermind, you dont have to do all the assignments. Whoever came up with this stupid paradigm should probably be fired.

Also, I just put together an alternative plan for a student to catch up in an honors chem class, because he didn't do anything for about 2 weeks. And I have him daily catch up tasks in addition to his normal school work because what he missed is crazy important for the rest of the course (mole concept).

I’m required to update grades weekly (2 grades a week) and parents can log in to see kids attendance/each assignment but it’s clear they never bothered to until I email them. This doesn’t even count the parents I can’t reach because they never bothered to update their contact info with the school. Parents btw are not asking me about the workload just demanding their kids be transferred out of AP, then getting angry when told that they can’t because the lower level classes are all full & due to Covid the counselors can’t jam 40 kids in a class anymore. (This has happened in every past year, to the point where teachers have to give up their desk to give kids a place to sit).",2 points,2020-10-11T21:18:53+00:00,0.073,0.881,0.046,-0.6906,1,231,28.02,35.11,88.28,5.76,33,3.46,0.87,2.6,1.3,0,1.3,0,0.43,0,0,15.15,3.9,0,0,0.87,0,2.16,11.26,2.16,0,0,0,1.3,0,0,1.3,7.36,0,0,6.93,0.43,0,0.43,0.43,0.43,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.73,0,0.87,0,0.43,0,9.96,3.03,8.66,1.3,11.26,3.03,1.73,0,0,3.03,3.46,0

And kids who were out of control.  
I do not know WHY she did this. I thought we were on good terms.  I should have kept fighting. I thought going up the chain was better than approaching top people because inmost jobs that is the normal direction. 
My daughter continued to struggle in the city school. Beaten by gang kids, joined the wrong crowds and was skipping to have sex by middle school.  From then on, we had a downward spiral that I could not stop.

You don't need to talk much or get a lot of 1-on-1 time to be noticed or to be known by your teacher. Speaking personally, I find myself paying the most attention to my quiet students. Sometimes I worry that they will feel unattended to or isolated from the group. However, when I remember what it was like for me in school, I remember having comfort in classes where I could be quiet and teachers would be accepting of that. That acceptance for you to just be who you are in a classroom, even if that person doesn't say much, means everything. When you get that from a teacher, they know you, they see you for who you are.

44,1936,ModernTarte,"Exactly. We are also taking away responsibility from students. 
I remember I had to keep track of my own test scores/project grades/papers/etc and ask my teacher about my grades to keep them up. Occasionally, I would have a teacher who posted grades on the bulletin board (with ID numbers instead of names) every few weeks. Even in college I had to calculate my own grades and double check my math with mid-term progress reports.
Now, students have them at their fingertips. Sometimes this results in students obsessively checking their grades and harping on the results before they even get the work back with the comments. Sometimes these students don’t understand anything about how grades work and are confused how they can “go from a 98 to a 73 just by missing one assignment,” even if that assignment was their final paper.  And, of course, sometimes students and parents don’t check in on the grades at all. Sometimes they ignore two or three quarters worth of grades and come out of the woodwork when they suddenly realize the student will have to repeat the course. 
Anyways, it generally should NOT be the teacher’s responsibility to contact parents when a child is failing. We already communicate with comments on progress reports/report cards. We already update grades each week. It should be the parents’ job to keep up with their child’s grades and check in with progress. Older children/teens should also hold responsibility to track their own grades and ask for help when needed.",1 point,2022-02-23T04:05:10+00:00,0.044,0.907,0.049,0.3182,1,256,56.35,77.29,51.74,37.04,17.07,1.95,1.56,0.39,0.39,0,0.39,0,0,0,0,14.45,2.34,0.39,0,0,0,1.17,12.11,1.17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.06,0,0,13.67,0.39,0,0.39,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.73,0,0.78,0,0,0,8.59,3.91,3.13,1.17,14.06,5.86,2.34,0,0,1.95,3.91,0

45,1963,Latvia,"I guess I’ve been a parent at odds with a doctor or two. When my daughter was 2, she got a staph infection. It was obviously a staph infection, and there was a lot of circumstantial evidence in support (other kids at her daycare getting staph just before she did, etc). 
So we brought her to the doc, told them “pretty sure she’s got a staph infection.” Well that doctor took our suggestion as telling her how to do her job, refused to test for staph, and gave a generic treatment plan for just a skin irritation. 
Well it kind of helped for a day or so, then the infection went crazy and landed my daughter in the hospital for three days while they put a drain tube for the golf ball sized cyst that had formed on her leg. To add to the trauma, she had just gotten potty training down, but could not get up and down easily with the IV system hooked up, so it basically undid her potty training which didn’t recover for another 6 months. 
And take a guess what the doctors found was the problem. A staph infection. 
Later we found an amazing doctor who would actually sit with me and look through her reference books when the kids had a health issue (I never requested or suggested that, she just did it).

I once had a review with my department head because a mouthy student with a known difficult parent wrote a letter with a story about me not ever trying to quiet the class down, where in reality I was using a hand signal to ask for silence and would stand at the board and wait for the class to be quiet before I would start speaking.  There’s obviously a context where this doesn’t work but I had been training the class for some time and was at the point where I didn’t need to yell, just stand patiently for ten seconds while the class realized I had my hand in the air and was standing pointedly at the board.  The department head had seen me do this and discussed it with me in a formal observation the day before.  What’s more, they presented the letter to me with the student name and class redacted in black ink and watched me as I read the letter.  It was my first time teaching full time and they were so mean and scary to me.

Remote learning is a subpar learning mechanism for school age Children. Private Remote learning also less expensive because parents have competative choice;public remote learning is being forced on parents  that have no choice.

There isn’t great data for teachers since COVID (that I could find), which is why I used 2014. Obviously it will have an impact, but I can imagine that it impacts both professions similarly.

I miss teaching, I don't feel like I am teaching right now.

Watching her feel guilty about not completing all the assignments.  This combined with the social isolation from her peers and friends is just making her shut down and I don't know how to help her.  I want her to keep her brain active but I am also frustrated with her teachers for their attitude during this crisis.  Their ""suck it up"" attitude is beginning to rub me the wrong way because I feel it is causing more harm than good.

I have been in person since the start of this year. My online days, which have happened due to regulations, have felt like more work than others. 
Kids will learn a schedule and stick to it if their parents set the expectation. If parents treat it like 'break' or throw their hands up and say ""It won't teach my kid properly! I need to be in person. I refuse to adapt"" then of course it seems like there is nothing going on.

51,2234,anikapo,"You are absolutely right. Teachers should be supporting each other. I'm glad that you have an understanding with your admin and community leaders that safety must be a priority. Unfortunately, that is not the case everywhere. Many areas like LA and Chicago still have high community spread. Even under their own state/local COVID-19 guidelines, LAUSD and CPS should not reopen, yet government leaders and public health officials (who probably have never taught in a classroom) insist these districts open immediately, threatening them with lawsuits if they don't. Teachers are all over the US are working their butts off. Unfortunately, to much of the public, teachers are ""lazy"" and the kids' mental health must take priority. That last talking point is laughable, because now they care about the mental health of students. Prior to the pandemic, it not like teachers were advocating for things to help with student mental health like gun control so that we don't have school shootings or have to run intruder drills or have students walk through mental detectors, and more importantly funding for student resources like school counselors, reduced class sizes, etc. Let's agree that the studies that are coming are right students don't spread/contract COVID in schools. Let's ignore the decades of parents sending their children to school sick, teachers coming to school sick because it's easier to teach then finding a sub and doing lesson plans, parents/communities who don't believe in wearing masks or getting vaccinated. I think it would be a rarity to find a teacher in America who doesn't have a student whose family hasn't been infected with this virus. Imagine if we all were face to face in August how many more lives would have been lost.
In addition, it sounds like you have a district that listens to it's teachers. Unfortunately, there are many districts all across America who have stripped teachers of their agency. One of the biggest complaints from the Chicago Teachers Union is that when they ask for exemptions to in person teaching, they are denied. Not only are they risking their lives by being in subpart ventilated buildings, they are risking lives of the loved ones they live with or have to take care of. 
I think what is comes down to is that if you are comfortable with face to face teacher that's okay. I like that you are sharing what is working for you and your situation.

If we are not in school, the teacher who normally has to assist with the bathrooming cannot be expected to drive to the students home to assist with the bathrooming. 
We do the bathrooming assistance because it is a natural consequence of being in the building. The same is true of most behavior ieps, that a student needs accommodations and assistance to function in a classroom. When there is no classroom, those accommodations have little meaning and are outside our mandate. Ofc we have legal obligations but those I think are outside the scope of the discussion. We give lunch not because we are there to feed children, but because we are holding them during lunchtime. When they are at home, they get lunch breaks instead of lunches and it’s up to others to feed the child, which is perfectly okay. 
I do think that we largely teach life skills as a side benefit to our main mission, in the same way that we keep them awake and alert as much as possible - since they are there anyway and it costs us little.

Look.  I’m glad it worked for you.  That doesn’t mean your colleagues at other school don’t still have a valid point.  The chances of a business (and far too many schools are run like a business) following the rules when it’s easier not to are slim.

For every student in your district that stays home when sick there are ten out there attending school not only while sick, but knowingly positive for covid.

So it’s great your school is doing things properly but the problem is for every school that opens and does things properly there will be ten that open unsafely, pointing to the good school as proof that it is safe to come back.

Do a song and dance at the front of the room? I rarely lecture for more than 5 minute segments, usually. I want them actively thinking and problem solving. My usual lsmall group work is out, right? So, independent work at their desks. Do I have them write in their notebooks? When they have a question, how do I see their work to help them without physically walking over to lean over their notebook? Do they call out their question for me to answer from the front? Fine for some kids, but many others will now never ask anything and just nod their heads and pretend to understand, which I will find out when I do my formative assessments...Wait, how am I doing those again? Collecting papers from the kids and immediately dousing them in Lysol? (Who is providing this Lysol, btw?) Maybe they can each have a little whiteboard at their desks to hold up and show me their work? Okay. Who is Lysoling those between classes? How are they recording their work to look back at later? Do I let them take a photo of everything they write and upload it to Classroom?

No one has asked us what the fall should look like (of course) but if they did I would suggest this. I’m in self-contained lower primary and to be honest, I haven’t really thought about what that might look like for departmentalized intermediate. 
I agree fully though, if there isn’t a compromise, I am prepared to fight someone because it would be doing two jobs at once and that would mean you couldn’t really do either job all that well.

I decided to go for my master’s in ID. It’s not required, but it is helpful. There are some areas that you must have it. It is a little difficult to get into the field.

There really is always something else hanging over your head and you have to learn to push it out of your mind at some point and just decide to deal with it later.

There's absolutely no shame in realizing at this point that you're not wired to handle that.  It might be one of the best life choices you could make.  I'd still recommend trying to hang in there for a year to see if your coping mechanisms kick in and help you out - I've seen it happen with folks!  In general, it would look better on a resume to say ""It wasn't for me, but I stuck it out"" than to leave mid-year... but it depends on what you pursue and whether sticking it out is going to make you completely miserable.

If we were each paid 6 figures then maybe you could argue that doing meetings outside of contract hours or work on the weekends or home visits to students we’re concerned about is included in the job. But you can’t have it both ways. And every problem can’t always come back to teachers! Education in the US is systemically flawed and broken, and the general disrespect for teachers is a part of that. Doing a little more or moving schools or setting boundaries might help but they’re all bandaids for the bigger issues on education.

It's not worth being observed / evaluated by admin that have NEVER experienced a day in this environment.

56,2436,sticklebat,"Yes I agree, but at the same time there’s basically nothing meaningful I can do in person while following social distancing rules that I couldn’t do remotely. Blended learning is, IMO, kind of the worst of both worlds: an increase in exposure risk for the whole community (especially in a big city where kids have to take public transit to get to school, like where I am) with none of the value of traditional in-person learning. Coupled with the facts that we have to cut our electives and advanced classes so that our students don’t have to switch classrooms and that we don’t actually have the time to simultaneously accommodate our in-person and remote students, nor enough staff to divide the work. The result is just an inferior education compared to what we could’ve accomplished remote only (at least for older kids; early education is an entirely different beast).",3 points,2020-08-13T03:00:32+00:00,0.113,0.794,0.094,-0.6539,1,149,55.4,52.07,45.17,29.25,37.25,2.01,1.34,0.67,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.75,2.68,0.67,0,0,0,0,8.72,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.71,0,0,6.71,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.68,0,1.34,1.34,0.67,0,4.03,0.67,6.04,2.68,14.77,2.68,3.36,0,0,3.36,5.37,0

56,2451,sticklebat,"For what it’s worth, what worked best for me and my students in the spring (after a great deal of trial and error) was kind of a flipped classroom. I uploaded or found a video explaining the content for kids to watch (edpuzzle is a useful tool to insert questions/comments into videos as checkpoints, but I tried not to use it too much because it limits how students can interact with the video in some ways), followed by some basic questions meant to reaffirm the video that were due by the start of our live session, followed by an optional set of harder problems. Then I’d have the live session with my students to answer their questions, do a couple harder examples, and then break them into groups to work on the rest of the harder questions together for a bit and then their homework was to finish. I always posted solutions for them to check their work - that way  the limited feedback I was able to provide was more effective. I held 2-3 live sessions per week, depending on the class, plus some optional “office hours.”
YMMV, especially depending on your subject. One thing I STRONGLY suggest is to have some sort of forum for you and your students to be able to communicate in writing as a group. Something like slack or discord works well. It enables you - or other students! - to answer quick questions and for everyone in the class to see (unlike email). It was not only useful but a good community builder for me: I’d pop in on days I didn’t see my students and throw out a “how are you all doing?” and we’d share memes and complain to each other.

56,2452,jenneration,Thank you. I am finding a lot more challenges because my little guys are in 1st grade and of the few who have a parent who can sit side by side with them there are almost none who have parents that can navigate easily on new platforms. I initially had an over load of organized info and hyperlinked google presentations. But it seems like I need to simplify the amount of navigating. I think the younger grade teachers need to consider the limitations of the home life. I am tweaking as I go along.

I started each class with norms, then a two-options check-in question that everyone unmuted and answered. (Students can respond to each other's answers in text chat only.) Then I gave announcements and showed my screen to give a brief overview on how to start the assignment. The rest of the period was dedicated to work! 
During work time, I had posted the assignment with ""make a copy for each student"" in Google Classroom, so I'd go and open each of their assignments, making a little comment out loud to the class for each one: ""Great answer, Charlotte!"" ""I see you haven't gotten started, Jimmy, can I help?""

In f2f, I always began by asking the day of the week and date in Spanish (Spanish class), going over the agenda, and having the students write down their homework. 
Then, as they worked on their review questions, I went around and checked homework at their desks. 
Every. Class. Few. Exceptions. 
For virtual asynchronous learning, I recorded a video of me answering the previous day’s questions, sharing riddles students sent in, and being silly. Then, they would go to the same place to begin their assignment. 
Establishing these norms and not deviating too much, students became accustomed to the normal routine and made the entire class easier to handle.

Education has always been shitty and it's getting shittier. Education as an institution is garbage now but it can be redeemed. COVID is just trying to get blood out of a stone in a tough situation and everyone everywhere is failing.
It breaks my heart to see what's happening to students in special education, especially those with severe/profound disabilities who've regressed. But the more I look at it the more I realize how it shows that society doesn't actually have any plans lined up for them anyway. If school going away takes away everything they've worked for then it's clear there's no actual independence being fostered. It's clear that after hitting 22 in my state it really is back to square one, and I hate to think that I was just teaching independent skills to kids so they can forget them before 23 if they don't get any sort of other placement or setting.
But that's not my fault. It's not anyone's fault. It's education's fault.

I will be monitoring and helping individual students from a safe distance. I have also cut group work so that we can continue socially distancing.""

But then that's my last chance to use the restroom, drink water, and my only chance to check on distance learning kids throughout the day. In addition, why not make passing a couple minutes longer so teachers can actually sanitize??
This may be entirely out of your control, but I just don't get it.

I have a UTI from being unable to go to the bathroom often enough—blocked classes, lunch duty, and the inability to leave 15 year olds alone for three minutes. I had fever spiking, breaking, spiking, breaking every few hours the night before last and was exhausted, along with feeling crappy, so I decided to sleep in and get to school after my first block. There are two teachers out in my grade level with COVID and one who just had a baby, so along with the ordinary sub problems they are intensified. When I said I needed a sub for one class, I was told that if it wasn’t COVID I needed to come in because there weren’t enough subs—from someone who had a sub herself that day due to a family member’s surgery and only wears a face shield instead of a mask.

The problem, that I, as a high school teacher, see this is: schools ARE NOT DESIGNED to follow the science (CDC guidelines?) and kids, even older kids, do stupid, unhygienic stuff all day long. Its habitual for them. Once schools open, they wont be able to keep them staffed because teachers are gonna be getting sick. Some of us will die. Some students will die. Many students, faculty. And staff will have long lasting health problems. 
I hate having to take this time I would ordinarily be planning for next year, to be updating my will and making sure my family knows my wishes. Seriously wishing I had tried harder to find a copy writing job or something before signing this year's contract. 
The people making these decisions don't have the vaguest idea what schools actually look like at the classroom level. Hell, kids socialize more through their phones than face to face, anyway. So all of this ""Oh they need to socialize"" is at least 50% (number I just made up) overblown as well.

61,2699,ThatIdea503,"Welp, I'll be the unpopular opinion in this post, I suppose.
I listened to the press conference and didn't think anything wrong with what she said at all. This title of this reddit post misleads people into what she was speaking about and totally takes it out of context.
She was speaking about how science shows that a lot goes wrong when students aren't in schools like identifying child abuse, suicidal ideations of students, mental health, etc. And also about how every other country has reopened and had success. 
I think a lot of school districts are in the position to be able to safely reopen schools. It's about being open to the idea of reopening and trying your best to make that an option. Of course, for some districts throughout the country, it may not be feasible... But the goal is to get them opened quickly and efficiently while following safety protocols and then pivot to another plan if it's determined that students are being hit more with Covid-19.
School is going to look different than what we've always known it to be, but we have to open up sooner rather than later. Plus, parents have a right to choose whether they want their children at school or not.
There's a big divide on the issue of schools reopening, but believe it or not, there ARE teachers out there willing to go back to the classroom to teach students and work with their administration to provide a safe environment for a successful school year.",-1 points,2020-07-17T02:29:08+00:00,0.032,0.862,0.106,0.9671,1,255,57.35,29.21,85.38,25.28,21.25,3.53,1.96,1.57,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.76,3.14,0,0,0,0.78,1.18,7.45,0.39,0,1.18,0,0,0,0,0,7.06,0,0,7.06,0,0,1.57,1.57,0.39,0,1.18,0,0,0,0.39,0.78,0.39,0.78,0,0,0,3.14,3.53,5.1,3.53,12.94,5.49,4.31,0,0,2.75,0.39,0

Daily new hospitalizations for COVID are the highest they’ve ever been, and it’s been a steady upward climb since the 5/18 phase 2 re-opening. Your rate of positive COVID tests is also the highest it’s been since at least April 25. It’s been hot in Texas for a while, and your viral statistics have not started trending in a good direction at all. Remember that new infections lag up to two weeks behind exposure, and new hospitalizations strike another week or two after that.
Harris County has had 275 COVID deaths. That’s about a month’s worth of traffic fatalities state-wide. It’s also about a month’s worth of your state-wide gun deaths. The dead have survivors who are trying to manage their lives and continue working in the absence of loved ones. Harris County has also had 16,778 confirmed virus cases. Many of those people will have shortened lifetimes and disability from COVID. 
I don’t know how to make people like you care about others. However, know that many do care enough to want to protect themselves, loved ones, and even strangers from dying if it’s preventable.",0 points,2020-06-15T01:34:34+00:00,0.064,0.795,0.141,0.9403,1,199,46.88,71.93,64.05,81.35,15.31,6.03,5.03,1.01,0.5,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,8.54,1.01,1.01,0,0,0,0,7.54,2.01,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.01,0,0,1.01,1.01,0,7.54,4.52,4.02,0,0,0,0,0,2.51,0,1.01,0,0.5,0.5,0,8.54,4.52,6.53,1.01,17.59,6.53,4.02,0,0,5.03,2.01,0

This right here is the single biggest thing you can do. A lot of the teachers stress isn't really because of the kids, it's because of all of the pointless extra things we have to do that take up so much time, all of the bureaucratic hoops we have to jump through to remain in compliance, and the fact that no matter what we do, we are often criticized (not constructively) from both the parents and our admin.
Kids who interrupt, distract the rest of the class, are generally rude, miss a lot of school  and/or don't turn in assignments on time  are a pain because that just gives us even more work to do when we are already over-worked. On an individual level, none of those behaviors is really a big deal at all, but when multiplied by 80-100 students, and added on top of everything else it often becomes the straw that breaks the back.
With all of that said, the little extra things you can do is just talk to your teachers. Ask them how their day is going, if they did anything exciting over the weekend, or talk to them about music, art, cats, whatever. Just be friendly, it really goes a long way when 50% of the student body seems to think that teachers are some sort of enemy out to get them for some (mostly but not entirely unjustified) reason.

But if you really want to do something valuable- have your grown up write a note to the principal saying how much you enjoy her class. An email directly to the teacher is hella good, too. Sometimes we have to document that we have built good relationships with students and parents, or that we provide a safe learning environment or other such immeasurable criteria that is really hard to document. A letter that a principal could put in her file or an email to her (even from you- although it’s often easier to get student notes than parent notes) that she could print out for a summative review would be so awesome.

For context, I was teaching grade 10 English as an addition language. Their assignment was to host a “cooking show” with food they love from their home countries in class. As an example I showed them a YouTube video of a chef creating burgers from the show Bob’s Burgers, with the voice actor of Bob. I had watched it passively a couple months prior and thought would be an awesome example. It was great, everything going fine until Bob ate the burger. His response to his first bite was something around the lines of, “holy f*ck, I just want to smoke a fat blunt and eat this burger.”

Like many compromises, it quiets some of the critics without actually solving any problems with reasonable degrees of effectiveness.
What's worse, IMO, is that many schools and districts are likely to be bouncing back-and-forth between fully online, hybrid, and fully in-person as the pandemic rages and numbers rise and fall. If we have a school year where every 2 to 4 weeks we have to switch modes again . . . .

A group has two online or in their workbook asynchronous activities for Tuesday/ Wednesday, B group does the same activities on Wednesday/Thursday. My whole week is offset like this. I did have to give one group a “filler” lesson at the beginning of the year to make this happen though. Basically I need two in person lessons and three at home lessons each week. I rarely have to create a video for the at home lessons because I’m having the kids practice with concepts that we have already discussed in class. We don’t use devices in person because not everyone can bring theirs to school, and we passed out all of the school chrome books. I have to do parent communication during my hours with no classes on every day but Wednesday. Wednesday we have no students, and are contractually guaranteed uninterrupted planning time for the entire day. I’ve been able to teach students how to access all of the online resources in person so there is no excuse when we inevitably have to transition to online.

70,3071,Zephs,"1) Try being a male teacher at a middle or high school with a dress code that girls choose not to follow. If I see them in the hallway I ask my female neighboring teacher to talk to the kid.

As a male teacher, this is actually why I like enforced dress codes for certain things, but it feels like it has to be the female staff that are on top of it. My first year supplying I asked a student to get started on her work like 15 minutes into the period. She turns to her friend and in a stage-whisper says ""he was only coming over to look down my top"". She was in grade 8. Noped out of there, informed the principal, and said I refused to be in the room with her anymore. If the staff had enforced the board-wide dress code in the first place, I wouldn't have been put in that position. But as other commenters have said, it must be all-or-nothing. You can't have selective enforcement. 
I had teachers in my high school that would only police spaghetti straps on the attractive girls, then creepy guy teachers that would only do it to the larger girls.",2 points,2021-01-27T02:02:01+00:00,0.013,0.885,0.102,0.9555,1,203,70.76,57.68,54.34,14.8,18.45,1.48,0.49,0.99,0.49,0,0.49,0.49,0,0,0,17.73,3.94,0,0,0.49,0,3.45,13.79,0,0.49,4.93,1.97,0,0,0,0,9.36,0,0.99,8.37,0,0,0.49,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.49,0,0,0,0.49,0,0,0,2.96,4.93,2.96,1.48,13.3,5.42,3.45,0,0,0.99,3.45,0

My personal philosophy was if I couldn't see boobs, butts, bellies, or bad content (i.e., drugs/alcohol/porn/profanity on the clothing), then it wasn't going to be my battle to fight. That worked pretty well for me. 
One principal I worked for had a personal vendetta against yoga pants. Another hated ripped jeans. Both would get mad that kids wore them, but teachers stopped turning kids in because the assistant principals were overwhelmed and didn't make the kids change.  They'd come right back to class 10 minutes later wearing the same thing.
It's one thing if a kid is wearing yoga pants that are see-thru, or if a jean has rips that give me a direct view of a kid's butt/crotch... But otherwise?

The majority of things I found egregious were for bad content. 
I had a student who once wore a black sweatshirt with white print that said FUCK YOU in both English and what I assume were the corresponding Japanese characters. She was in my last class period of the day, and she got to class a few minutes early. Before I could say anything besides her name, she sheepishly said, ""Is it my sweatshirt?""
I said of course it was, and then asked her a few questions. She told me she had indeed been wearing it all day and that I was the only teacher who noticed it, which actually made me sad. I gave her the option of either turning it inside out or sticking it in her locker until the end of the day, as long as she promised she would never ever ever wear that to school again.

71,3099,cdsmith,"I taught as a volunteer at a school in New York with 2 minute passing periods, that was in a building with 7 floors + the gym in the basement.  Of course, students are required to use stairs unless they have an elevator pass.  I was teaching on the 6th floor.  The answer is that you just stop expecting students to arrive on time, because they are physically incapable of doing it.
Which means for many of them, passing periods are effectively however long they think they can get away with.  It's very difficult to address a student being late to class, because everyone knows there's no real expectation of being on time.  So that was terrible.
It also means students get used to the fact that there are interruptions and distractions while you teach; more students walking in, chatting as they get to their seats, arranging their backpacks loudly for two minutes.  And this spills over into a general lack of expectation that they should be focused and ready to learn, even after everyone is there.  That was even more terrible.",4 points,2020-07-23T13:09:48+00:00,0.117,0.843,0.04,-0.9267,1,181,51.63,81.96,73.3,9.57,18.1,3.31,1.1,2.21,1.1,0,1.1,0,0,0,0,13.81,3.87,0.55,0,0,0,1.1,9.94,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.63,0.55,0.55,5.52,0,0,1.1,1.1,0,0.55,0,0,0,0,0,0.55,0,1.66,0.55,0,0,6.08,3.31,6.63,2.76,12.15,5.52,4.42,0,0,1.1,1.1,0

Super active and super likely to do something dangerous, still need naps, loud, old enough to know that things are different and not okay, but too young to really understand why. Like 2-5 year olds. So for parents with kids in pre k, who do attend school, I think this applies.
With middle and high schoolers, for neurotypical children who can be put on a schedule with little oversight and have some self management tools and everything... I largely agree.
My team leader has three active late elementary to mid high school aged kids, and while they have way less of an effect on our meetings than my daughter, it's still work to keep them on track all day while trying to manage your own work. And she's rocking it. But she has great kids who have been supported in learning how to function.
While some parents are not figuring out how to breastfeed a screaming baby with admin on your call (this sentence is my entire life in lockdown)... It's just that parenting children of all ages is tough.

73,3197,jeabgrenouille,"I agree that we make a lot of decisions, but your comment about us getting tons of work done is one that I would challenge.
As their teacher, I can be 'mean' and set boundaries. You can do that as a parent too, but I know a lot of people find that very difficult. When I am at certain table, it means I am working with someone and I should never be interrupted. We practice that explicitly and we talk about it often. When someone comes to interrupt me, I can be harsh and ignore them or shoo them away, reminding them of the rule, and they generally listen. If I were a parent, I wouldn't be able to shoo my child away so easily. I would guess that children would be more likely to listen to their teacher in that circumstance, and less likely to give up and leave their parent alone. 
The other thing is, the work I am doing in a room full of kids is for the kids. I don't do paperwork or planning when my kids are in the room. I know lots of teachers do, but I do that during my planning periods and while my students are in the classroom, I am hands, ears, eyes on at all times. The work I am trying to get done is for them and with them. It's not the same as me trying to have some peace and quiet so I can focus on my work. I get interrupted a lot, but I can keep moving forward each time rather than always having to settle back into whatever I was trying to do.
I really feel for parents trying to work from home. I do think it is very hard on them. I am NOT a parent so I should not even comment this, but some of them straight up do not all have good management skills, like you said. They don't have our training and practice. I know how to keep a kid busy. I know how to set rules/boundaries/procedures. I know how to talk to kids. I know what kids are capable of, etc. Some parents do not know these things and they are just drowning, telling me that they can't get their child to do anything because they say they don't want to. In some families, the kids rule, and the parents have no idea how to do things any differently. I find this to be true, especially with my EAL families and families where the parents are separated. When the teacher is communicating, the child understands better than the parents. The parents rely on their children to help them understand and I think that does impact the power dynamic in the family SOMETIMES (certainly not always!!). With divorced parents, the parents sometimes compete with each other for the child's affection and the child gets too much power in that situation as well. 
As their teacher, I don't have those factors either. In my community anyway, teachers are very respected, and I don't have to worry about whether or not my students like or love me so I can do what I think is best for them regardless of whether or not my students like it.",6 points,2020-04-28T13:56:29+00:00,0.057,0.828,0.115,0.991,1,545,13.06,28,80.89,35.88,18.17,2.94,2.02,0.92,0.73,0.55,0.18,0.18,0,0,0,16.88,2.94,0.55,0,0,0,1.28,13.76,3.85,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.59,0,0.55,4.04,0,0,0.73,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.18,0.37,0.18,0.92,1.28,0.18,0,2.75,0.92,7.71,0.37,13.58,5.5,4.95,0,0.37,2.02,0.73,0

We have multiple social workers and psychologists on staff (and we are a small HS for our district with 1,200 students, our ratio of support staff to students is unusually high). We have a full service health clinic with nurse practitioners and therapists that is also open to the public. Students can get physical and mental health care (including therapy and preventative care like check ups) just down the hall from my classroom. I think it’s wonderful. Our principal has been begging the superintendent to add mental/physical health and social emotional support to our accreditation / school performance indicators for years. The heavy academic lifting can’t happen until you take care of the rest of the child. 
I’m confused by the teachers on Reddit that have been so offended that people are suggesting schools are mainly there to provide childcare for working parents. That’s always been one of the primary purposes of public education. If you’re going to make it mandatory to send children somewhere for 40 hours a week so parents can work it only makes sense that those places would also help with nutrition, health, and social emotional learning. We are a tribal species and parents were never meant to do it alone - we were always meant to have a community of support. Echoing the commenter who mentioned allocare - it’s believed that’s one of the main reasons humanity advanced. The fact that we share the duty of child raising so that we can get more done as a tribe. It’s literally our biological norm. 
I also find working at home with a small child to be totally different than managing a classroom, for the commenter who suggested maybe working parents need to work on their “classroom management.” Are you writing lessons, leading conference calls or writing software code while teaching? They’re two separate jobs. It’s imposible to do cognitively demanding tasks while simultaneously caring for and interacting with small children. It is much more difficult than my job in the classroom because I’m managing my students’ behavior in our online classes and interacting with parents/students while ALSO parenting my child.

But I wouldn't agree with your point that this is a new row for schools. They have always been an institution of socialisation. They always performed a vital role in establishing discipline and character. Discipline has taken a back seat, and creativity and mental health have been stepped up as priorities (basically, and I'm generalising, collectivism was succeeded by individualism). This was also done with the decline of religion and the education churches provided. 
Another thing to consider - maybe there is a good reason why teachers are underpaid. If it was a well paid profession, would it not be attracting people for the wrong reasons? Some would argue that there is a system of filtering as a result of low wages. Schools are still underfunded though, and facilities need more investment in them.",-20 points,2020-04-27T21:32:21+00:00,0.104,0.754,0.142,0.7948,1,174,22.7,63.86,11.47,46.24,13.38,6.32,4.02,2.3,1.15,0.57,0.57,0,0.57,0,0,13.79,4.02,0,0,0.57,0.57,0.57,9.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.34,0,0,8.62,2.3,1.15,1.72,1.72,0,0,1.15,0,0,0,0,1.15,0,1.15,0,0,0,1.72,8.05,6.32,0,14.94,6.9,3.45,0.57,0,1.72,2.3,0

73,3232,KT_mama,"Are you really trying to argue that schools are underfunded because they are trying to do the job of the church and because they are focusing too little on discipline? And that teachers should be underpaid as a way to only attract those that really want to be there for moral reasons? 
The school I teach at has a very religious community and is discipline oriented. Guess what? We are still vastly underfunded. Between the churches and our school, our kids eat but they don't get quality educational materials (unless the teachers buy them), they don't get any actual mental health services, their parents don't get parenting/job/educational resources, and many of them are struggling with extreme poverty. Why? Because if the church is funded by the otherwise poor local community, they still don't have any more money. They need the state to equalize some of those services, in part because that's what taxes are for and in part because that's the best move for our society as a whole. This also doesn't address the issue of what is done when no church is present or the student/their family do not attend church. Do they not deserve nessecary social aide because they are not actively religious? 
Beyond that, the evidence we have available proves that large swathes of repeat behavior issues stem from unaddressed mental health issues. Addressing mental health IS addressing discipline. The difference is that addressing discipline from the lense of mental health actually gives children the tools they need to understand how to do better.
The ""right reason"" to be a teacher is the education of children. No, paying more money to teachers would not attract the wrong people. Why? Teaching is fucking hard. Corraling 23+ children of varying educational, emotional, intellectual, etc levels and creating a cohesive, enriching experience for them is HARD. We weed out most of those that are there ""for the wrong reasons"" just by the nature of the job. The ones that still stay are those that are in a position where they can be last because they have no competition. Creating a competitive market forces them out or gets them to step up. We also start to attract back those that have left as part of teaching's horrific turnover rate. Those that are capable and willing but would also like to be paid like the professionals they are. 
I get your ""good ol days"" stance, I do. But the reality is that the good ol days don't exist in education. We know SO MUCH MORE about children, how they think, how they learn, and how to help them not only grow as students but as people. If we are not using that information to actually serve their interests, whether in the school or through other public avenues, then we're actively neglecting the future of our country and our species. I'm not saying we do that even close to perfectly now. I am saying that the church should play it's role (religious services) and that we shouldn't actively rely on them to do more because that does not address our freedom of religion or equity of services. I am saying that discipline and creativity/mental health are not mutually exclusive. I am saying that paying teachers more only benefits schools and students.",4 points,2020-04-28T04:02:45+00:00,0.086,0.803,0.111,0.9521,1,552,23.92,70.54,19.62,22.49,17.25,3.8,1.81,1.63,0.91,0.36,0.36,0.18,0.18,0,0.18,15.58,2.72,0.18,0,0.18,0.72,0.91,12.5,0.91,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.6,0.18,0,5.62,2.17,1.81,1.99,1.81,0,0,1.81,0,0,0.18,0,0.36,0.18,1.09,0.54,0,0,1.63,0.54,9.06,0.18,14.13,4.71,3.26,1.09,0,2.36,2.72,0

77,3380,Anonymous,"The linked website lists more purposes than what you quoted. Look at the chart. Is the act and means present? Yes. You asked about the purpose... see ""other types of exploitation."" Maybe you should be more worried about the thousands of teachers so overburdened they aren't even afforded enough time for a medically recommended about of sleep. Maybe you should follow up with the hundreds if not thousands of teachers assaulted each year and find out if administrators treated them with hostility afterward or even with retaliation for reporting it. American education does not put children first anymore.  It's all about high pay for the higher ups and procurement contracts for their buddies.  Teachers are a necessary expense but which teachers they hire doesn't matter to them as much as they just need teachers who will put up with the situation. With many exceptions, administrators mostly just want to limit the expense and hassle of dealing with teachers. Why staff properly when a superintendent can just expect new teachers to work the equivalent of at least two shifts daily, and then encourage older, more experienced, more expensive teachers to leave the profession.  As long as the administrators shine, a good portion will not care about the hardship on teachers. They just push for teachers to do more with less. What other profession begs and hold fundraisers for copy paper?  The exploitation has reached an unrealistic level, and mostly teachers leave after a few years. You don't have to see the obvious. You can choose to be in denial and be angry at the messenger, but in the United States, the education system relies on exploiting teachers to an unreasonable, unrealistic degree. Teachers are lured into the profession through recruitment efforts and offers of payment. They think the workload will be more realistic than it actually is. Contracts leave teachers stuck for a year at a time, and all the while they are exploited for that year. I've seen a contract where teachers had to pay to end it early.  You may think of human trafficking as certain very horrible situations, and it is those situations, but it's not limited to those situations. I didn't write the definition, but I do recognize that the extreme exploitation of teachers fits the criteria. Is the exploitation of teachers the most extreme example of human trafficking? I think it's not. But it's definitely on the Hunan trafficking spectrum.
