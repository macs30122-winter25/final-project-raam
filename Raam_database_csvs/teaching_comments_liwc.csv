1. Start by connecting with a few kids outside of the lesson- this might be after class, if they finish an assignment early, etc. Ask about an interest and let them teach you about it. Seek it out on your own time and tell them what you‚Äôre learning about it and begin a convo, maybe including more kids. It‚Äôll show you‚Äôre a learner, interested in learning from them, and in them. It goes a long way and kids see this who are not necessarily involved in the initial convo.

Learn about their families- it‚Äôs amazing the struggles these kids have that are both extraordinary and ordinary. Most often kids aren‚Äôt listened to at home and are used to being ignored, so when asked how they‚Äôre doing it‚Äôs strange many times. Ask questions that offer an option to share their experiences and connect with peers by offering low-stakes options to respond. Instead of ‚Äúhow are you?‚Äù (a personal question to a whole group is hard) maybe say, ‚ÄúI had the weirdest dream I was being chased by a clown last night and couldn‚Äôt go back to sleep. Anyone else ever have crazy dream like that?‚Äù 
Set a foundation for respect by a) never addressing an individual‚Äôs misbehavior in front of the group - take them outside, b) always giving benefit of the doubt until a pattern emerges, then call attention to the pattern as a teachable moment, c) think aloud through your social-emotional decisions. If you‚Äôre frustrated by their lack of a response to a question you‚Äôre posing to connect with them, tell them ‚Äúhey guys, I‚Äôm asking you this question because I care about how you‚Äôre feeling. It don‚Äôt feel valued when I ask and no one speaks. What can we do instead of speaking to answer the question?‚Äù (This is a high-level convo, maybe 10th grade one.)
As a SEL warm up, ask them to share out something on a piece of paper anonymously, then read the (appropriate) papers aloud- great community-building exercise.
Usually being respectful of their personal struggles sets all the stage you need (don‚Äôt you remember adolescence?! The struggle is very real for them - even though we know there‚Äôs life after teens, they don‚Äôtüëπ). Maintain high expectations but help them get there by teaching them to manage themselves to get there- this is more than content. In fact, 90% of what they learn in your class is just how to deal, the content is just the vehicle. Be clear of your expectations and do a lot of reflection on those goals and what behaviors are contributing to or hindering their getting there.

Like I said I could really go on forever,  but I‚Äôll try to end with this: in 13 years I‚Äôve never met a kid who is bad in their heart. The worst behaved or most checked out are the most in need of compassion, understanding, and someone to show them how to be productive desultory despite their emotions (when possible- relationships with counselors and families is so important to this point too).
Ask how they are tomorrow and if you don‚Äôt get a response, you can say ‚ÄúI am struggling with this current climate now too. [Insert way you‚Äôre struggling if you feel comfortable.] I am going to try to make sharing here more comfortable and we‚Äôll work on it. I understand it can be tough sometimes to open up in school, but let‚Äôs work on this together.‚Äù Resume your lesson and try a different opening SEL activity the next day.",1.18,0.51,0.34,0,0.17,0

I adopt a similar attitude as OP, my students and their parents are happy, they do well on their tests, and as a result my administration likes me despite the fact that I break or ignore all sorts of rules and standards. 
The thing is, I've seen plenty of veteran teachers stop caring too much. They stop doing or half ass genuinely important things, their students don't get the support they need, etc. But as things are now (at least in my district), tenure is so strong that a teacher would basically have to physically abuse a student to be fired. Attempting to deal with those teachers has resulted in a lot of bullshit rules and bureaucracy to make it a little bit easier to reprimand and eventually make a case for removing them. But to teachers already doing their job it's all just a drain and a waste of time. Like I said, I mostly just don't do all that crap and my administration leaves me alone, but at the cost of weakening their case if they do try to get rid someone (if a teacher can prove that a rule is being selectively enforced then it can't be used against them). 
TL;DR Teachers should be given a greater degree of professional freedom and we shouldn't be expected to dedicate our time outside of regular work hours to school.

Furthermore, many also lost their jobs they maintained while in school due to layoffs and health concerns.
While I am on the younger side I am now starting my career late which means I will be dealing with the impact of my teaching pension later in my life. Regarding your insurance comment many of my peers now are not insured at all. While I am a dependent on my parents insurance, it is significantly less then what I would receive as a teacher, which would have resulted in me not paying out of fully pocket for any treatment this year however now I will pay out of pocket this year all without having a stable job. The boards here are not hiring new teachers and are rather hiring from the sub list. Which I support in that many of them deserve those positions however this means thousands of new teachers are unemployed.
I agree I may have more freedom in my career options right now and can find work elsewhere. I disagree in that teachers with families are in a worse spot.

Realistically in every middle/high school I've seen in my city, which is all of them, social distancing is not possible unless they cut class sizes down below 15 students. So that means masks all day. Adding how impractical it is to cohort high school students, hallway encounters, students who believe that it isn't that bad, teachers who believe covid isn't a big deal, inability to maintain that level of sanitation, teacher exhaustion from lack of breaks, insufficient supplys being provided, etc. I think this is going to spiral and our system will cause a second wave where I live.

Hemingwayapp - AWESOME for my ELA students. Keeps them from going on long run-on sentences.
Kahoot! - Such an awesome way to quiz materials in an interactive and fun way. 80% of my kids this year, before even getting to know me, asked me if I would do Kahoot!. Super popular with the kids.
Poll Everywhere - An awesome visual way to do quick polls, word clouds, and surveys. The results update with visual charts in real-time, so it's super fun and interesting if you can incorporate it into a lesson.
NewsELA - Allows you to assign and read many, many, many various articles on ALL sorts of topics. Super relevant stuff and they crank the articles out every week.

The text chat is deprioritized in an annoying way, similar to in Zoom, though I believe there's one small perk which is that messages briefly show up as video overlays when you have text chat closed.

You can have each breakout room in a separate tab (be sure you can mute tabs - use an extension if needed) so you can click among the rooms. 
I created a document that has unique links for each class and breakout rooms that I will just reuse throughout the year.

25,1043,"Chin up, teachers.
This year is fucking hard.
This is my 17th year teaching, and I‚Äôm teaching a K/1 combo remotely.   I am a great teacher, but teaching remotely is the hardest thing I have ever done.
It is so stressful. I‚Äôm anxious all the time.  I‚Äôm on technology for ten or more hours a day.   I hate that I can‚Äôt hug my littles every day.  I miss being sneezed and boogered on. I miss tying 20 shoes everyday.  I miss the authentic conversations we had that are impossible to duplicate on Zoom.  I miss building deep relationships with my kiddos.  I miss it all.
The thought that keeps me going every day, is knowing that we are stepping up for our students.   I‚Äôm watching some of my best friends teach in-person, and they are struggling, too.  We are perfectionists, and knowing my students will not leave me at the end of the year where they typically do is killing me.   We are not lowering the bar; it‚Äôs just a different bar.   No matter where you are teaching, we are all having the same struggles.
We are in the same storm.  We are in different boats, but doing our very best to weather this goddamn storm.
Relationship building is more important than ever this year.   We are masters at being calm on the outside while we are falling apart on the inside.
I believe in all of you.  We are in this together.

In between each ‚Äúsample‚Äù insert a text box that asks the students to grade the sample according to the rubric and asks for 2-5 sentences explaining why they gave it the grade they did according to the rubric. 
Go over one or two of the samples with the class and have them grade and discuss them as a class so they really get to know the rubric.

So, with regular printing, you get to lift the pencil after every letter, which allows you to lift your hand to reposition it, you also get to start and end the letter at at point that feels and flows the best. With cursive, you don‚Äôt get to do that, and end up having to lift your pencil mid-word, which throws off the flow of the writing. Letters have to begin on the left and end on the right, which causes lefties to do loops and such that aren‚Äôt supposed to be there because the motion is unnatural to them and right-handed teachers don‚Äôt have the ability to teach it correctly(by no fault of their own). I was ALWAYS in trouble for doing that because my right-handed teachers never understood.
Every letter ends to the right, and usually requires a smooth taper to transition to the next one, that‚Äôs really hard for a lefty. Try making a check mark with your left hand starting from the left side. It‚Äôs a simple motion, but it doesn‚Äôt look good when pushed vs pulled. You end up making a V instead of a check.
Also, the way you hold your pencil and paper is COMPLETELY different. I used to get in trouble for ‚Äúproper posture‚Äù constantly. My teacher gave me a pencil grip that was supposed to help me hold my pencil correctly, but it didn‚Äôt work because it was made for right-handed people. I watched this happen again when I was in another teacher‚Äôs classroom 2 years ago. The student was holding the pencil correctly for a lefty, but because the teacher was right handed, they assume the student‚Äôs poor cursive was due to the way they held their pencil.
And, if you‚Äôre using a ball-point or rollerball pen, the metal around the ball just scratches so horribly. On bad enough paper(like the thin brown stuff some schools have) it‚Äôll rip through no matter how softly you write.
Right-handed teachers don‚Äôt understand the struggle and don‚Äôt know how to help lefties because they are not left handed themselves, so they really need to be a bit more understanding if they‚Äôre going to force cursive on the kids. Lefties are super adaptable and learn how to do things their own way with the right guidance, and unless a teacher is going to let them, they shouldn‚Äôt force it upon them.",0.48,0.24,0.24,0,0,0

I think that teachers should be a highly trained, sought after, trustworthy professions. Administrators can do all the behind the scenes work so that teachers can just design lessons, teach the children, and assess student work.

How do we know fire fighters are really putting out fires? How do we know dentists are filling cavities? Bankers are really depositing checks?

Because you can tell if a fire is put out or not. And if your dentist is shitty, you can simply go to a different one.

None of those are remotely reasonable comparisons to teaching, which is a public service. You can't just switch teachers like you can switch dentists.

WHY are we not trusted enough to ""be in compliance??""

Because some teachers aren't trustworthy. I have worked with some who've been bad enough that they were fired before and in spite of tenure, and more who should have been fired but couldn't be because they were tenured 15 years ago and realized they could do almost nothing and the union would nonetheless protect them. In your model, how do you fire a teacher who is bad at their job? How do you demonstrate that they're bad? Who does the hiring and firing?
From the second part of your comment, what you're really saying is that you aren't fine with shitty administration who require pointless busy work from you and don't provide adequate supervision or support where it matters.

It is turtles all the way down . . . the idea that you need to have an entire job of middle managers forcing ""compliance"" from a profession they chose to leave and now receiving twice the pay doesn't answer why those managers don't then also need oversight, and so on and so on. 
The idea that there is no inherent oversight or way to gauge success vs. failure for classroom teachers the way there is in fire departments (another public service, by the way), dentistry, etc. is absurd. None of these jobs are clear cut--fires aren't all the way contained, fillings eventually decay, clerical errors occur, etc.
Yes, there should be some way to gauge whether students are learning or not. How does admin tell whether a teacher is successful and deserving of praise or not successful and needing support? How does a principal fire a 15 year tenured teacher now? Who is on the interview panels for hiring new teachers now? Furthermore, who is hiring and firing principals? Which has more job security: a new teacher bad at her job, or a new principal bad at his job? (Spoiler: it's the principal.)

it's an argument to have higher standards and more accountability.

37,1594,"You are putting words in my mouth and I don‚Äôt appreciate it.

Can I ask why you find teachers so untrustworthy

I don‚Äôt find teachers, as a monolithic entity, untrustworthy. I find an unfortunate number of my colleagues, as individuals, untrustworthy. And I don‚Äôt think teachers are less trustworthy than others, but there are systems of accountability in place for almost every other profession, and pretending that teachers are so magical that we don‚Äôt need accountability is delusional.
They do the bare minimum needed in order to safely retain their jobs, and the only reason they even do that much is because if they do less, the administration will be able to fire them. And at least where I work, the minimum established by the union contract is woefully insufficient, IMO. 

If plenty of ""licensed professionals"" don't do good jobs, why would principals and admin be any better?

There are fewer of them, which means it is easier and more practical to hold them to high standards. I‚Äôm not arguing that all administration is good, but there are good admins out there and that should be the aspiration. Ultimately a school‚Äôs administration answers to the school‚Äôs community (in most cases, that‚Äôs not as true in very large districts), and so communities with a strong emphasis on education tend to have competent administrators. Also, there is value in having a consistent vision for a school, which you‚Äôre not going to get from a school run as a FFA by all its teachers. There are also decisions like: what courses should be taught? How should we spend our budget - on hiring more teachers? Expanding extracurriculars? Who hires and fired employees? At some point you just end up with administrators again.
I do agree with you that administrators pay is often excessive, and administrations are sometimes bloated. There are also plenty of bad administrations. All of those things are not good and I won‚Äôt defend them, no matter how hard you try to conflate those things with ‚Äúadministration‚Äù in general.

The idea that there is no inherent oversight or way to gauge success vs. failure for classroom teachers the way there is in fire departments (another public service, by the way), dentistry, etc. is absurd. None of these jobs are clear cut--fires aren't all the way contained, fillings eventually decay, clerical errors occur, etc.

Now you‚Äôre just being obtuse. An incompetent firefighter will be fired by their chief. They have a boss. An administrator, who can observe their work and judge their failures. Professional firefighters also go through rigorous training and exams that directly correlate to the skills and knowledge that they need to fight fires, which in itself is a fairly straightforward practice. If you have such confidence in teacher certification programs, and you think teaching is as straightforward as firefighting, then you and I went through very different experiences to get certified, and have very different standards for education. Also, your dentistry example is completely irrelevant. Dentistry is a private practice, and if you‚Äôre unsatisfied with your care, go find a new dentist (also a dentist proven to be negligent will lose their license to practice). Students can‚Äôt just go sit in a different classroom if their experience with a teacher is bad. A bad dentist will go out of business or be shut down because they‚Äôre bad. A bad teacher with no oversight will just continue to be a bad teacher.

How does admin tell whether a teacher is successful and deserving of praise or not successful and needing support? 

I can tell you how good admin does. They spend a lot of time observing new teachers. They have competent veteran teachers mentor them. They have weekly meetings with their new teachers and look over their assignments and assessments. They offer help when they see a need and ask if there‚Äôs any other supports that would help. And if the lessons they observe flop consistently, or the students regularly fail reasonable assessments, or there are tons of complaints from students and parents, then perhaps the teacher needs more help. And if the teacher demonstrates no desire to grow or improve, or the mentor expresses exasperation, then maybe that new teacher isn‚Äôt capable or isn‚Äôt a good fit. But someone has to make that determination. Who is that going to be, if not an administrator? Do we become like the police: ‚Äúwe have investigated ourselves and found nothing wrong.‚Äù? Because that sure works well...

How does a principal fire a 15 year tenured teacher now? 

That‚Äôs not a problem with admin. It‚Äôs a problem with unions and tenure. But my school actually has fired a couple long-tenured teachers recently. Admin observed them often enough that they were able to sufficiently demonstrate their incompetence that not even the union could save them. That‚Äôs certainly the exception rather than the rule, but my question still stands:  Do you agree that it should be possible to fire bad teachers? If no, then have a nice day, you‚Äôre crazy. If yes, how does that work without administration? Who decides to fire teachers?

What if all those ""untrustworthy"" teachers you've encountered were magically not in the profession, the way you are saying all bad admin would just magically not be in the profession?

That isn‚Äôt what I said at all. The ratio of administrators to teachers is (or should be) small. It is much easier to 1) find a small number of very competent people than a large number, and 2) to hold a small number of people to elevated standards than a large number of people. This is just practical. I am not saying that administrators are magically amazing at their job, nor that the country doesn‚Äôt have a problem with bloated or incompetent administrations. The system needs to be fixed, but the only magical thinking happening here is that if you leave teachers to their own devices with no oversight that they‚Äôll do a better job. That may be true in a handful of cases where devoted and skilled teachers are being shackled by absolute shit administrators, but that‚Äôs gonna be the exception, not the rule.",2.35,1.08,1.08,0,0.2,0

Graphic organizers are a great example of a tool that looks like it works in practice, but in terms of actual transfer of learning they don‚Äôt work at all.  
Teachers want success now, and so some prefer to teach procedure over concept, rote memorization over flexible strategies.  The former can be done by one teacher in isolation and it works for that test.  But in terms of a school or the kids‚Äô experience over time it does a disservice to the child‚Äôs learning.  The latter on the other hand supports a child‚Äôs learning over the long term.
This is why I argue strongly against student performance being directly linked to teacher pay or tenure.  Student performance over the long term isn‚Äôt determined by how well they can crank out addition problems, but instead by their number sense and how well they understand place value.

I remember I had to keep track of my own test scores/project grades/papers/etc and ask my teacher about my grades to keep them up.

Even in college I had to calculate my own grades and double check my math with mid-term progress reports.
Now, students have them at their fingertips. Sometimes this results in students obsessively checking their grades and harping on the results before they even get the work back with the comments. Sometimes these students don‚Äôt understand anything about how grades work and are confused how they can ‚Äúgo from a 98 to a 73 just by missing one assignment,‚Äù even if that assignment was their final paper.  And, of course, sometimes students and parents don‚Äôt check in on the grades at all. Sometimes they ignore two or three quarters worth of grades and come out of the woodwork when they suddenly realize the student will have to repeat the course. 
Anyways, it generally should NOT be the teacher‚Äôs responsibility to contact parents when a child is failing. We already communicate with comments on progress reports/report cards.

So we brought her to the doc, told them ‚Äúpretty sure she‚Äôs got a staph infection.‚Äù Well that doctor took our suggestion as telling her how to do her job, refused to test for staph, and gave a generic treatment plan for just a skin irritation. 
Well it kind of helped for a day or so, then the infection went crazy and landed my daughter in the hospital for three days while they put a drain tube for the golf ball sized cyst that had formed on her leg. To add to the trauma, she had just gotten potty training down, but could not get up and down easily with the IV system hooked up, so it basically undid her potty training which didn‚Äôt recover for another 6 months.

Even under their own state/local COVID-19 guidelines, LAUSD and CPS should not reopen, yet government leaders and public health officials (who probably have never taught in a classroom) insist these districts open immediately, threatening them with lawsuits if they don't. Teachers are all over the US are working their butts off. Unfortunately, to much of the public, teachers are ""lazy"" and the kids' mental health must take priority. That last talking point is laughable, because now they care about the mental health of students. Prior to the pandemic, it not like teachers were advocating for things to help with student mental health like gun control so that we don't have school shootings or have to run intruder drills or have students walk through mental detectors, and more importantly funding for student resources like school counselors, reduced class sizes, etc. Let's agree that the studies that are coming are right students don't spread/contract COVID in schools. Let's ignore the decades of parents sending their children to school sick, teachers coming to school sick because it's easier to teach then finding a sub and doing lesson plans, parents/communities who don't believe in wearing masks or getting vaccinated. I think it would be a rarity to find a teacher in America who doesn't have a student whose family hasn't been infected with this virus.

In addition, it sounds like you have a district that listens to it's teachers. Unfortunately, there are many districts all across America who have stripped teachers of their agency.

Not only are they risking their lives by being in subpart ventilated buildings, they are risking lives of the loved ones they live with or have to take care of.

We do the bathrooming assistance because it is a natural consequence of being in the building. The same is true of most behavior ieps, that a student needs accommodations and assistance to function in a classroom. When there is no classroom, those accommodations have little meaning and are outside our mandate. Ofc we have legal obligations but those I think are outside the scope of the discussion.

51,2256,"I think one of the big things with teachers having fear about going back F2F even though other districts are already doing it is that they know just how powerless they will be if their district/administration refuses to implement and/or enforce safety protocols. Some districts and some building principals will be safety-minded and will enforce the necessary protocols. Their teachers will still have trepidation about going back, but will find that it's not as bad as they feared it might be. Still not totally carefree, but better than they anticipated. Other districts and principals will pay lip service to safety protocols and not enforce a damn thing and their teachers will be all but helpless to do anything about it. Their fear about returning to school will not abate once they go back. It all depends on the district- and campus-level decision making and there isn't any kind of uniformity in that. I think that's sort of what OP was getting at...our teaching situations are all so different that it's pointless to argue among other teachers about this issue.

Look.  I‚Äôm glad it worked for you.  That doesn‚Äôt mean your colleagues at other school don‚Äôt still have a valid point.  The chances of a business (and far too many schools are run like a business) following the rules when it‚Äôs easier not to are slim.
For every one of your students who wears a mask there are ten out there who won‚Äôt.  For every student in your district that stays home when sick there are ten out there attending school not only while sick, but knowingly positive for covid.  For every administrator backing up your rules to wear a mask there are ten out there that will just cave to a parent complaining masks do more harm than good
So it‚Äôs great your school is doing things properly but the problem is for every school that opens and does things properly there will be ten that open unsafely, pointing to the good school as proof that it is safe to come back.

I uploaded or found a video explaining the content for kids to watch (edpuzzle is a useful tool to insert questions/comments into videos as checkpoints, but I tried not to use it too much because it limits how students can interact with the video in some ways), followed by some basic questions meant to reaffirm the video that were due by the start of our live session, followed by an optional set of harder problems. Then I‚Äôd have the live session with my students to answer their questions, do a couple harder examples, and then break them into groups to work on the rest of the harder questions together for a bit and then their homework was to finish. I always posted solutions for them to check their work - that way  the limited feedback I was able to provide was more effective. I held 2-3 live sessions per week, depending on the class, plus some optional ‚Äúoffice hours.‚Äù
YMMV, especially depending on your subject. One thing I STRONGLY suggest is to have some sort of forum for you and your students to be able to communicate in writing as a group. Something like slack or discord works well. It enables you - or other students! - to answer quick questions and for everyone in the class to see (unlike email).

Education has always been shitty and it's getting shittier. Education as an institution is garbage now but it can be redeemed. COVID is just trying to get blood out of a stone in a tough situation and everyone everywhere is failing.
It breaks my heart to see what's happening to students in special education, especially those with severe/profound disabilities who've regressed. But the more I look at it the more I realize how it shows that society doesn't actually have any plans lined up for them anyway. If school going away takes away everything they've worked for then it's clear there's no actual independence being fostered. It's clear that after hitting 22 in my state it really is back to square one, and I hate to think that I was just teaching independent skills to kids so they can forget them before 23 if they don't get any sort of other placement or setting.
But that's not my fault. It's not anyone's fault. It's education's fault. It was likely always like this since we don't have any real social underpinnings that education serves; we serve education which is what marks the decline of any institution's moral core; when it's sold out.",0.43,0,0.43,0,0.43,0

I will be monitoring and helping individual students from a safe distance. I have also cut group work so that we can continue socially distancing.""

The problem, that I, as a high school teacher, see this is: schools ARE NOT DESIGNED to follow the science (CDC guidelines?) and kids, even older kids, do stupid, unhygienic stuff all day long. Its habitual for them. Once schools open, they wont be able to keep them staffed because teachers are gonna be getting sick. Some of us will die. Some students will die. Many students, faculty.

I listened to the press conference and didn't think anything wrong with what she said at all. This title of this reddit post misleads people into what she was speaking about and totally takes it out of context.
She was speaking about how science shows that a lot goes wrong when students aren't in schools like identifying child abuse, suicidal ideations of students, mental health, etc. And also about how every other country has reopened and had success. 
I think a lot of school districts are in the position to be able to safely reopen schools. It's about being open to the idea of reopening and trying your best to make that an option. Of course, for some districts throughout the country, it may not be feasible... But the goal is to get them opened quickly and efficiently while following safety protocols and then pivot to another plan if it's determined that students are being hit more with Covid-19.
School is going to look different than what we've always known it to be, but we have to open up sooner rather than later. Plus, parents have a right to choose whether they want their children at school or not.

This right here is the single biggest thing you can do. A lot of the teachers stress isn't really because of the kids, it's because of all of the pointless extra things we have to do that take up so much time, all of the bureaucratic hoops we have to jump through to remain in compliance, and the fact that no matter what we do, we are often criticized (not constructively) from both the parents and our admin.
Kids who interrupt, distract the rest of the class, are generally rude, miss a lot of school  and/or don't turn in assignments on time  are a pain because that just gives us even more work to do when we are already over-worked. On an individual level, none of those behaviors is really a big deal at all, but when multiplied by 80-100 students, and added on top of everything else it often becomes the straw that breaks the back.
With all of that said, the little extra things you can do is just talk to your teachers. Ask them how their day is going, if they did anything exciting over the weekend, or talk to them about music, art, cats, whatever. Just be friendly, it really goes a long way when 50% of the student body seems to think that teachers are some sort of enemy out to get them for some (mostly but not entirely unjustified) reason.

The answer is that you just stop expecting students to arrive on time, because they are physically incapable of doing it.
Which means for many of them, passing periods are effectively however long they think they can get away with.  It's very difficult to address a student being late to class, because everyone knows there's no real expectation of being on time.  So that was terrible.
It also means students get used to the fact that there are interruptions and distractions while you teach; more students walking in, chatting as they get to their seats, arranging their backpacks loudly for two minutes.

With middle and high schoolers, for neurotypical children who can be put on a schedule with little oversight and have some self management tools and everything... I largely agree.
My team leader has three active late elementary to mid high school aged kids, and while they have way less of an effect on our meetings than my daughter, it's still work to keep them on track all day while trying to manage your own work.

73,3197,"I agree that we make a lot of decisions, but your comment about us getting tons of work done is one that I would challenge.
As their teacher, I can be 'mean' and set boundaries. You can do that as a parent too, but I know a lot of people find that very difficult. When I am at certain table, it means I am working with someone and I should never be interrupted. We practice that explicitly and we talk about it often. When someone comes to interrupt me, I can be harsh and ignore them or shoo them away, reminding them of the rule, and they generally listen. If I were a parent, I wouldn't be able to shoo my child away so easily. I would guess that children would be more likely to listen to their teacher in that circumstance, and less likely to give up and leave their parent alone. 
The other thing is, the work I am doing in a room full of kids is for the kids. I don't do paperwork or planning when my kids are in the room. I know lots of teachers do, but I do that during my planning periods and while my students are in the classroom, I am hands, ears, eyes on at all times. The work I am trying to get done is for them and with them. It's not the same as me trying to have some peace and quiet so I can focus on my work. I get interrupted a lot, but I can keep moving forward each time rather than always having to settle back into whatever I was trying to do.
I really feel for parents trying to work from home. I do think it is very hard on them. I am NOT a parent so I should not even comment this, but some of them straight up do not all have good management skills, like you said. They don't have our training and practice. I know how to keep a kid busy. I know how to set rules/boundaries/procedures. I know how to talk to kids. I know what kids are capable of, etc. Some parents do not know these things and they are just drowning, telling me that they can't get their child to do anything because they say they don't want to. In some families, the kids rule, and the parents have no idea how to do things any differently. I find this to be true, especially with my EAL families and families where the parents are separated. When the teacher is communicating, the child understands better than the parents. The parents rely on their children to help them understand and I think that does impact the power dynamic in the family SOMETIMES (certainly not always!!). With divorced parents, the parents sometimes compete with each other for the child's affection and the child gets too much power in that situation as well. 
As their teacher, I don't have those factors either. In my community anyway, teachers are very respected, and I don't have to worry about whether or not my students like or love me so I can do what I think is best for them regardless of whether or not my students like it.",0.73,0.55,0.18,0.18,0,0

Students can get physical and mental health care (including therapy and preventative care like check ups) just down the hall from my classroom. I think it‚Äôs wonderful.

73,3230,"Well observed, and well concluded. Schools are severely underfunded for the service to society they provide. But that's precisely why - teachers know how much children depend on them so they allow themselves to be exploited. Only stronger unions can save teachers. 
But I wouldn't agree with your point that this is a new row for schools. They have always been an institution of socialisation. They always performed a vital role in establishing discipline and character. Discipline has taken a back seat, and creativity and mental health have been stepped up as priorities (basically, and I'm generalising, collectivism was succeeded by individualism). This was also done with the decline of religion and the education churches provided. 
Another thing to consider - maybe there is a good reason why teachers are underpaid. If it was a well paid profession, would it not be attracting people for the wrong reasons? Some would argue that there is a system of filtering as a result of low wages. Schools are still underfunded though, and facilities need more investment in them.",1.15,0.57,0.57,0,0.57,0

The school I teach at has a very religious community and is discipline oriented. Guess what? We are still vastly underfunded. Between the churches and our school, our kids eat but they don't get quality educational materials (unless the teachers buy them), they don't get any actual mental health services, their parents don't get parenting/job/educational resources, and many of them are struggling with extreme poverty. Why? Because if the church is funded by the otherwise poor local community, they still don't have any more money. They need the state to equalize some of those services, in part because that's what taxes are for and in part because that's the best move for our society as a whole. This also doesn't address the issue of what is done when no church is present or the student/their family do not attend church. Do they not deserve nessecary social aide because they are not actively religious? 
Beyond that, the evidence we have available proves that large swathes of repeat behavior issues stem from unaddressed mental health issues. Addressing mental health IS addressing discipline. The difference is that addressing discipline from the lense of mental health actually gives children the tools they need to understand how to do better.
The ""right reason"" to be a teacher is the education of children. No, paying more money to teachers would not attract the wrong people. Why? Teaching is fucking hard. Corraling 23+ children of varying educational, emotional, intellectual, etc levels and creating a cohesive, enriching experience for them is HARD. We weed out most of those that are there ""for the wrong reasons"" just by the nature of the job. The ones that still stay are those that are in a position where they can be last because they have no competition. Creating a competitive market forces them out or gets them to step up. We also start to attract back those that have left as part of teaching's horrific turnover rate. Those that are capable and willing but would also like to be paid like the professionals they are. 
I get your ""good ol days"" stance, I do. But the reality is that the good ol days don't exist in education. We know SO MUCH MORE about children, how they think, how they learn, and how to help them not only grow as students but as people. If we are not using that information to actually serve their interests, whether in the school or through other public avenues, then we're actively neglecting the future of our country and our species. I'm not saying we do that even close to perfectly now. I am saying that the church should play it's role (religious services) and that we shouldn't actively rely on them to do more because that does not address our freedom of religion or equity of services.

Maybe you should be more worried about the thousands of teachers so overburdened they aren't even afforded enough time for a medically recommended about of sleep. Maybe you should follow up with the hundreds if not thousands of teachers assaulted each year and find out if administrators treated them with hostility afterward or even with retaliation for reporting it. American education does not put children first anymore.  It's all about high pay for the higher ups and procurement contracts for their buddies.  Teachers are a necessary expense but which teachers they hire doesn't matter to them as much as they just need teachers who will put up with the situation. With many exceptions, administrators mostly just want to limit the expense and hassle of dealing with teachers. Why staff properly when a superintendent can just expect new teachers to work the equivalent of at least two shifts daily, and then encourage older, more experienced, more expensive teachers to leave the profession.  As long as the administrators shine, a good portion will not care about the hardship on teachers. They just push for teachers to do more with less. What other profession begs and hold fundraisers for copy paper?  The exploitation has reached an unrealistic level, and mostly teachers leave after a few years. You don't have to see the obvious. You can choose to be in denial and be angry at the messenger, but in the United States, the education system relies on exploiting teachers to an unreasonable, unrealistic degree. Teachers are lured into the profession through recruitment efforts and offers of payment. They think the workload will be more realistic than it actually is. Contracts leave teachers stuck for a year at a time, and all the while they are exploited for that year. I've seen a contract where teachers had to pay to end it early.  You may think of human trafficking as certain very horrible situations, and it is those situations, but it's not limited to those situations. I didn't write the definition, but I do recognize that the extreme exploitation of teachers fits the criteria. Is the exploitation of teachers the most extreme example of human trafficking? I think it's not. But it's definitely on the Hunan trafficking spectrum.
