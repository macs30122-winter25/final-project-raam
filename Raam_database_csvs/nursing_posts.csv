5,2021-11-23T19:16:50+00:00,Aloha_Snackbar357,"Struggling to Not Care about my Antivax Patients","On paper, it’s not a problem.  Fuck Around and Find Out.  These are the natural consequences of making stupid choices, just like losing your feet from uncontrolled diabetes, or dying of liver failure after the millionth detox visit.  Bad decisions are literally my bread and butter, and I like it that way.  That’s why I’m not in peds.
My antivax patients start off in the category of “well I guess we’re finding out today, aren’t we?”.  They come in with their bravado intact, and usually find that all the verbal abuse, snark and conspiracy theories in the world do nothing against a bunch of nurses who have done this for almost 2 years.  We are blunt, honest, and quick to offer AMA papers.  Their feelings on covid’s existence doesn’t change the treatment course or their prognosis, and we aren’t going to waste our time arguing about it.  You have the right to refuse any treatment, I’ll document and be on my way.  You can try to demand nonsensical treatments, but you’ll have to go home for that.  Here’s the papers. 
Then, inevitably, it comes as the edges of a person start to crumble and crack. “Am I going to be ok?”  “I’m so tired.”  “I’m not getting out of here, am I?”  “I don’t think I’m getting better.”  I give them the only kind answer: “I don’t know, but I hope so,” even though we both know I’m talking to someone who is already on Death’s list.  And then, even worse, comes the inevitable question: “How’s this gonna go, then?”  We talk about the paths - one path is them turning around and recovering.  One path is them being intubated and dying.  One path is them being intubated and recovering, including the possibility of a trach and peg, lost fingers and toes, permanent disability.  
I encourage them to talk to their family, to share their wishes and what they were willing to live with and not live with.  I encourage them to say what needs to be said, just in case.  Then the blunt nurse comes back and tells them to prone their ass if they want to avoid the what-ifs becoming the happening-nows.  And I leave them to make those calls, think about their wishes, and think about what they want to do.
There’s nothing satisfying about saying “I told you so” to a person who is confronting their own death.  It’s like kicking someone when they are down.  There is no comfort in telling myself “fuck around and find out” when literal children come in to wave goodbye to their parent through the door or through the phone.  There is nothing OK about watching kids turn into orphans because of their parents’ belief in lies fed to them through the media.  It’s not OK that people my age with kids the same ages as mine are going from bravado to bagged in a week’s time. It’s not that we lose every time - hell, right now we have a whopping 5 covid patients on the unit.  The problem is that all 5 are probably going to die.  Maybe 1 will make it.  And they are so young, leaving behind children or young adults; people who still need their parents.  When I’m at work I compartmentalize just fine.  I have a job to do, after all.  But later, when I realize there’s a 17 year old playing his last high school football game tomorrow and his dad, who had resigned to watching it through a screen, won’t be watching at all, I can’t help but grieve for an asshole who played the odds and lost.

They MADE her come in after 5 days of quarantine and said to her face, I was also in the room as a witeness,:
“ We know you’re still positive, and we know you’re still probably shedding the virus, but that’s the policy. The CDC says it’s fine so🤷‍♀️.”
We work in the ICU and also with a lot of cancer patients (we are one of the few facilities around here that is still doing cancer treatments). The hospital is literally putting these peoples lives at risk.
Every patient she had that day was informed by her that she was COVID positive and she was made to work that day. If they are not comfortable with a COVID positive nurse, they can be reassigned.
Floor manager: surprised pikachu face 😂😂. 
8/10 of her patients requested a different nurse. 
Also, they tried to deny that this conversation happened. I guess they forgot I was in the room?? Now everyone is in an uproar and “No OnE KnEw ThIs PoLiCy WaS EnAcTeD”. 
Update: wow guys! I honestly didn’t expect this to blow up. I was going through these comments with my friend and she’s aghast at the support we have gotten. Thank you thank you thank you😭😭.
I know it’s people are suggesting secretly recording conversations while at work. We both live in a two person consent state. Not having consent can land you a nasty felony charge. I would encourage anyone to check the laws in their state before recording.
Last update: I’m so happy there are so many nurses standing in solidarity with us! Thank you again. 
I’m going to be turning off notifications because my phone is blowing up. We are lucky enough that this is a travel contract that will be ending next week. We have already told our recruiters that we will not be taking additional contracts from this hospital.

​
I created this account solely to write this post, because I need to say it somewhere, somewhere people might understand, a nurse to nurse connection. If you don't read it all, I understand. I mean, its word vomit. If you make it to the end, treat yourself.
I'm a nurse. ADN, practicing for 7 years. I cut my baby nurse teeth on a step down, learning vents and drips and transplants and people on the mend but not quite out of the reaper's shadow. I loved it. I loved my vented patients, watching as they weaned off the vent and became them again. Watching the stroke patient walk in the hall for the first time again. I only quit that floor because I worked Baylor Shifts and felt like my time with my kids was slipping away from me. From there I tried a few different nursing specialties - oh man I absolutely hated substance abuse/rehab nursing, I don't know how you guys do it. I always found myself back on a stepdown unit.
My family and I moved for my husband's job, and I got a job at the local hospital. It's a tiny-ass hospital in the country, a ""critical access hospital"", surrounded by the frozen midwest, in the country where binge drinking is the state sport and people compare their number of DUIs like others compare their golf scores. All the old people are ancient white people with diabetes, hypertension, obesity, with god knows how many stents in their hearts and usually a GFR you can count on both hands, sometimes need a few toes. The young ones are stubborn redneck types, good ol boys n girls who live hard and party hard.
A nurse in a critical access hospital does it all. Regular med-surg, transitional care, outpatient services, and covering the emergency room. This particular cah had a 4 bed ER with a CT - we took traumas for stabilization and shipped them to the bigger sister hospitals an hour in each direction. I saw shit you wouldn't believe - gunshots, tramplings, stabbings, car wrecks, frostbite/hypothermia, tractor trauma, and the usual group of strokes, stemis, PNA, etc.
Then Covid happened. Fucking covid. My cah was one of the few that built a covid unit to house our own covid cases, as the sister hospitals quickly drowned under the constant waves and locked transfers down to full codes needing intubation/ecmo/crrt. Everything else stayed at our facility until they got better, got dead, or crumped enough to qualify for a wee-woo ride to the big houses.
Our covid unit was a fucking joke. The wall was thick tarp held together with this zipper thing you can buy from any hardware store. There was no reverse isolation. Those rooms were meant for transitional care, so there were no vitals monitors in the rooms, the doors were solid wood with no windows into the room, not all of the rooms had Oxygen access, and the call light system only rang to one of the 2 nurses stations, both outside of the unit. I could see the writing on the wall as covid marched towards our state, so I got together with the doctor that had been voluntold to man our covid committee, and with a few other nurses I knew, we made that unit from the ground up. Assigned manual vitals equipment to each room. Bundled O2 supplies for grab and go bags. Made a shifty supply closet/housekeeping room. Took over the patient dining room and made it into the report room/on call room/breakroom. There were only 6 of us that worked the unit regularly, so many of the ""clean"" nurses had elderly parents they cared for, or the others had tiny babies (or were pregnant). I've got kids but they're older, so I volunteered for the unit. I'm dumb - I see people running away, I run towards it. The nurse aides did not go in the unit. Actually no one other than the dirty doctor and the dirty nurses went back there. That's what we called each other - the dirty ones, the unclean, the cootie carriers. That group had some of the blackest damn humor I had ever seen, and I felt like I was at least with a group of nurses that could take whatever this fucking virus threw at us. This was when covid was essentially giving you a 50/50 chance of living, no one quite knew how to treat it, so regulations and standards changed every damn day. I wore the same n95 for 14 days, stored it in a paper lunch bag between uses. Had to make our own goggles from a 3d printed set the community donated.
God how do I explain that nursing care. I had no centralized monitoring. No automatic inflating bp cuffs, PO thermometers only, O2 sat monitors were handheld units. I'd have 3 or four patients, of course they were all diabetics. So many .damn.diabetics. With 2 hr sugars that were off the chart because of the dexmeth we pumped them full of. This cah had 1 cpap/bipap, one high-flow heated nasal cannula, and 1 vent that was a transport vent that did not have breath sensing capabilities - that thing had manual dials, if that gives you an idea of how primitive this damn thing was. And supplies were non existent. Gloves, gowns, shoe coverings - I was constantly stealing shit from the ""clean"" side of the hospital to keep us a little more secure.
We didn't take our n95s off in the hall because there wasn't reverse air for the unit. We had to keep the doors shut. So in one shift I pretty much went room to room, doing assessments and med pass, then rounding again to do adls, then assessments and lunch pass, then adls/nap/housekeeping, then assessments and supper pass. That only worked if everyone was cool with staying alive, but covid patients really struggled with that concept. It got to the point where we could identify a patient who was at that magic tipping point by their lung sounds (or lack there of) - If you lost sound in the RLL, if the o2 needs shot up and their HR hit 130 just rolling over in bed, you were fucked. Might as well get the bipap parked outside and wait. But remember, we only had that one, and we were boarding 6 covids at a time...you do the math.
That's what started my downslide. I had a night shift in which my three patients were all attempting to unalive via respiratory distress bordering on failure, and with the MD not on site but hauling ass across town to help us stop them, I had to make the snap decision of who got the lone bipap, who got the lone HHFNC, and who I put on a venturi and prayed for. THAT IS NOT SOMETHING NURSING SCHOOL EVER FUCKING DISCUSSED. NO ONE TOLD ME I WOULD HAVE TO DETERMINE IN 30 SECONDS WHO DESERVED TO LIVE THE MOST AND WHO I HAD TO DECIDE WAS GOING TO HAVE TO SINK OR SWIM. I watched these patients drown, suffocate, have strokes, massive PEs, MIs, die with froth coming out of their mouth, or grabbing their chest, or stuck staring at the corner from a deviated gaze as their brain starved to death in its own waste products. Family wasn't allowed in there. We didn't have face time. So I would call family and tuck the phone to the dying person's ear, held in place with a pillow. I couldn't stay, I had other patients that needed me as well. Not that all of my patients died. The ones who lived, god I cried every time I wheeled someone to their loved ones car. Some went home on oxygen, 60 yo farmers who had been ranching up until their admission, or 50 yo women active on their kids little league board and makes a mean hotdish for the church fellowship. People who shouldn't need oxygen just to leave, but they had 30% of the lung function left. I couldn't prone my patients, there weren't enough of us to roll them correctly and the beds didn't support it anyhow. My crash cart was a craftsman mechanics toolbox. My defib unit still had paddles. Do you have any idea what it is like to watch the healthcare system crumble in front of your eyes? Of course you do, you're probably a nurse like me. There is one sticking point in my brain that I won't ever forget. Our bipap was an ancient thing, and we couldn't find any filters for the intake inlet anymore -  everything was sold out, backordered 6 months minimum. So. I washed it, by hand, hit it with peroxide, and left it to dry over a heat vent, praying that it held up between patients. We had bipaps, nebs, you name it, and we knew this put us at higher risk, but it was all we had.
I did this for a year straight. And ten months in, there was a string of deaths and I.just.broke. My kids' teacher was one of my deaths. I went home that night, knowing he had died an hour after my shift was over. I looked in on my sleeping kids (from a distance -  I was terrified I would bring this mystery disease home and kill my family) and knew when their dad put them on the bus they would find a sub in the classroom and find out their teacher was dead and they wouldn't know it but I had killed him trying to save his life. I mean, dirty doc and my partner said there was nothing else I could have done, we could have done, but I knew it. We had a massive MI, then a septic shock, and then the teacher, and then another resp failure, and then I couldn't see the way out anymore.
I went home. My family was still doing the work/school thing, because everyone was convinced covid wasn't a thing in this area and my husband and I couldn't homeschool because we both worked ""essential"" (read: disposable) jobs. The house was empty. It was cold and grey outside, and cold and grey in my head. I sat down and looked at my pill bottles. Wellbutirn, lexapro. baby aspirin. Then the usual covid meds - zinc, vit d, vit c.
I did the math. I figured out the lethal dose of my wellbutrin and lexapro, doubled it, and figured out how many days I'd have to skip to build that much up. I laid awake and stared at the ceiling every night, lying next to my sleeping husband when I wasn't isolated in a guest bedroom due to an exposure at work, wondering if there was any way out of covid. was there an end? did I kill my patients? would I get it and die? would I kill my family by bringing it home? why had our sister hospitals turned their backs on us? Night after night, or day after day if I was on night shift, I slept 4 hours and my mind spun in the same tired circles before and after sleep. I stopped smiling. I cried coming home from work each day  I tried to explain to my other nurse friends the distress and damage I had, but they were all non-critical staff who worked from home or cross-trained to admin areas. They didn't understand why handwashing bipap inlet filters would make me want to scream. They didn't understand the wounds I wore from each time I had to allocate my scarce resources. How many phone calls I had made for the last words, or the few family members that were already positive for covid I snuck in the emergency exit to the unit so they could say their quick goodbyes. how many patients I sat next to for a quick 5 minute pep talk, urging and begging them to keep fighting, that they could do this, I would be here for them.
Dirty Doc found me outside of the locker room. I had planned to shower, but the effort to walk the 25 ft from the outside bench to the women's showers was pretty much a mile and I curled up on that bench, forehead to knees, heels to butt, and cried. Not the ugly crying, not the cathartic crying, but the quiet, shaking defeated crying you do when there aren't any more tears but you have no other options. He sat next to me, didn't say a word. Just sat there. He was warm and familiar in the cold aseptic locker area. I could smell the alcohol handwash and bleach wipes on his scrubs. Eventually my crying stopped and I just sat there, completely empty, silent, broken. He sat next to me, quiet, present, and waited for me to catch my breath. We didn't make eye contact. We both found the floor fascinating to stare at.
""Hey. Hey."" he said quietly. It was a little hard to hear him through his n95. ""Come back a little bit.""
I nodded and wiped my face. The inside of my surgical mask was slobbery from my snot and tears and drool. I grimaced. It was like when I sneezed into my n95 and was stuck wearing it for 3 hours because my patient was not cool with the whole stay living thing. ""I'm here. I'm, I don't know what I am, but I'm here at least.""
""I need you to do something please."" he said, and finally glanced at me. I was empty and blank, and I just waited to hear what the new demand was. ""I need you to tell us, tell me if you are getting next to that line in the sand. You know that line. The line we can't come back from. We need you, your family needs you, and you need to tell us if you are at the bottom of the well.""
I stared hard at the floor. Was I that obvious? I wonder if anyone had an idea that I knew exactly how many tablets of my meds I needed to take to guarantee I wouldn't wake up again. He must have sensed something. So I just nodded. I opened my mouth, but my tongue was glued to the top of my mouth, my mouth suddenly the sahara. I croaked out a yes. And then I sighed again.
I left the unit 3 months after. Actually, I completely left the bedside. I got a job in nursing administration. I am the evil I hated during that year of black, the ones who smiled from their home computers, called me a healthcare hero, knowing I was stapling my surgical masks together to last longer, handwashing fucking bipap filters, being exposed on a weekly basis.
This week, I finally admitted to that dirty doc that I had been contemplating the ultimate retirement option. I told him that had he not come to find me, sit with me, and tell me to keep moving forward, I would've washed down those meds when I got home, before my family could get home. He nodded. He had figured as much. He said my eyes were dead giveaways - they were blank. Lights were on but nobody was home anymore. I had already started saying goodbye in my head. He had seen that look before, he said - in his premed classes, a classmate had that look. Next week, empty seat, empty dorm, and a funeral 5 states away attended by a broken bewildered family.
Thank God he had seen it before. He had seen it before and he had the strength in his time of disaster to take me aside and connect with me, one survivor to another. He left the covid unit 6 months after me. He works in a clinic, where they can't house covid patients, and he can try to forget about the patients he sent to the cah to be admitted for covid. We still talk on the phone, send each other stupid tiktoks, take time to catch up on our breaks. I caught covid this year. And sometimes, we just sit there. We stare off into the distance, but we're really looking back, hearing the alarms, feeling the familiar frustration as someone's lungs just noped the fuck out, smelling the coffee recirculating in our n95s again. Then we come back, and we look at each other. One of us will say, we made it. The other one will say, we're still here. And the spell is broken and we talk about the kids, the job, dance classes and basketball teams.
But every so often, I think about how I danced on that line in the sand, the line you can't come back from. I think about allocation of resources, about wave after wave of covid, and I wonder how many nurses and doctors and emts and aides crossed that line. How many didn't have a dirty doc to call them back? How many of us just put our hands down and slid under the black surface of complete hopelessness? How many more are trying to tread the water?

That’s 20% of our staff.","As it says in the title, 20% of our total staff chose to go unvaccinated. I’m in the ER. We are losing 2 ER doctors and a few nurses. One nurse has 20 years of experience. Don’t know how many other doctors were losing throughout the hospital.  They are being “resigned” so they can all return in good standing in the future. 
The hospital is so understaffed now, before the resignations, that they hired 40 travelers at $100/hour. After the first week, a bunch of travelers quit because it was so bad. Then they upped the traveler pay to $125/hour to keep the remaining ones. Everyone (even regular staff) automatically gets double time for any overtime and everyone who is vaccinated gets a 10% raise. They to have yet to give regular staff a huge raise. We all got 5% last year. 
You know what the fucking crazy thing is? My ER isn’t even that busy. We are getting COVID patients, but I’ve had some chill nights in the past 2 weeks. You know what’s happening? All these COVID patients aren’t dying. They’re lingering on for weeks or months on end on bipap, intubated or ECMO. We have them sharing rooms- a bipaper next to an intubated patient. We rented a 5th ECMO machine. We had two pregnant ladies on ECMO at once. 
I’m damn fucking proud of the nurses I with with, because I know we are all fantastic nurses. I’d let nearly anyone of them work on me. Lots of people aren’t saying if they are vaccinated or not. Come Monday, I’ll be honest, I’m gonna be sad.  Not only because of the increased stress our hospital will have, but because we’re gonna lose a ton of experience. 
Im not saying it shouldn’t be mandated, I’m just saying that losing friends hurts.
Edit: I have received lots of questions regarding my coworkers. Apparently I can’t individually respond because I don’t have username flair? I don’t know how to get that and I’m confused by the subject. Haha. Anyway, the two questions I’m getting are: 
1) Why aren’t they getting vaccinated? 
2) Where are they going? 
For the first question, these reasons come with counter arguments. I’m not here to argue, I’m pro-vaccination, this is just what I’m getting from them. Oh, and I’ve never heard one colleague say they refuse to believe the vaccine works. 
1) Many state that they don’t want to take a vaccine that’s only been out on the market for a less than a year- they want more long term studies to ensure safety. 
2) Others say they don’t want to be mandated to take it, period. 
3) Pregnancy is another reason. Yes, the pregnant ladies have said they would rather “gain natural immunity” (AKA, get COVID) during pregnancy than get vaccinated. Some already have. They also know the numbers in our maternity ward for Covid + patients has increased dramatically during Delta. 
4) They’ve already been exposed to Delta and don’t want the vaccine. 
Second question. 
Some are going to telenursing, going back to online school, focusing on their side jobs, or retiring. I know one who is going to a cosmetic plastic surgery office. 
Again, not here to argue. Just stating what they’ve told me.",7630,"458 comments",https://old.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/ppq3sf/my_hospital_will_forcibly_resign_all_unvaccinated/,0.071,0.833,0.096,0.9532
15,2021-08-26T17:25:12+00:00,CrystalCat420,"Covid from a NICU perspective","Tonight at 2000, we will admit our 6th baby born to an unvaccinated, Covid mom on ECMO. I’m currently caring for a 26wk premie who’s mom passed away last night after the family removed life support. He never met his mom- she survived on ECMO for 23 days before suffering arrest and brain damage. They have 2 other kids at home. 
Tonight’s delivery will be a 28 weeker. Mom has been on ECMO for 2 weeks and they haven’t been able to get her sats above 70% for 2 days so it’s time to take baby before we lose them both. 
They told Dad to expect Mom to survive for a day or so after delivery. 
This will be our 6th baby that will never meet their mom since Covid started. We always hear moms say they worry about what the shot will to do baby, but they never consider what not getting the shot will to do baby. I’m not sure how much more I can handle.
Update: I got a lot of great questions so I thought I’d address them. Our 6th baby was born tonight and she’s doing well all things considered for a 28 weeker. Mom worsened after surgery but I clocked out and don’t know much more beyond that. 
We don’t automatically deliver Moms on ECMO. Baby remains on continuous monitoring and if we see the baby is worsening or mom is nearing death we operate if it’s the partner’s wishes. Typically moms don’t tolerate the csection well and delivering the baby doesn’t necessarily mean mom suddenly improves, so we avoid delivery to allow baby time to grow if at all possible. 
None of our babies have tested positive for Covid. We resuscitate/transition in private rooms adjacent to the ORs to avoid exposure once baby is out. We test the babies at 24h, 48h and 7 days old. They stay in isolation until all 3 tests are cleared meaning partners/spouses can’t visit until the 7th day. 
I live in a very anti-vax, low education state. We are the main nicu in our city. I’m sure my experience is jaded by our higher numbers. I’m hoping those of you in higher vaccinated areas are having a much more pleasant time. 
I am enrolled in a therapy program. Covid has completely screwed me up, I’ve never held so many motherless babies or taught so many young widowed partners learn to care for a baby on their own.

For you in the OB world: tonight my meth-addled patient involuntarily pushed out a frank breech baby under conscious sedation. If none of that makes sense to you, keep reading, dear Redditor: it will.
In my 16 years as an L&D nurse, this night takes the cake.
So, coming on at 7pm it’s a little busy, but we don’t exactly need roller-skates yet…. I get report from Nurse 6th-Shift that there’s a patient coming up from ED. She presented to the ED with abdominal pain two days ago. They took one look at her mental health history (schizophrenia) and apparently decided that everything that came out of her mouth would be lies. She told them she was 37 weeks pregnant. So they did a chest x-ray, and an ultrasound that showed she was 33 weeks pregnant and then discharges her schizophrenic ass to the street.
2 days later, she shows up back in the ED, and in the interim, she’s managed to find enough methamphetamine to blast her into florid mania. My report from 6th-Shift was “well, in the same 3 minutes she told me she is the Queen of Hawaii, an attorney, and that her parents owned the hospital.” Also, that her baby is alive, and that her mania turns into belligerent violence about every 5-7 minutes.
“I told the ED doc that I can’t tell whether she’s in preterm labor or not because she tried to punch me.  I told them she should probably come up to L&amp;amp;D so we can figure it out.” After 2.5 hours of this patient raising holy hell in the ED, they joyfully but slowly bring her up to us.  Excellent call, Nurse 6th-Shift.
Spoiler alert: the patient delivered 2 hours later.
To my endless delight, the one thing that the ED doc did correctly in this situation was to order 2 mg PO Ativan, and 5mg IM Haldol. Bless his heart, he couldn’t figure out to send her up to L&amp;amp;D for evaluation of her abdominal pain, but he sure as fuck could snow her for us.
Good man.
She arrives curled up and filthy on a stretcher.  She is somnolent, but cooperative enough that we’re able to herd her onto the labor bed.  Just after the exasperated ED nurse leaves, the patient suddenly becomes very animated. “I gotta PISS!!!!” Writhing in the bed, clutching her belly: she is the very picture of labor. I put a hand on her rock-hard abdomen and my stomach drops to my knees.  At this point, all I know is: she had an ultrasound 2 days ago that put her at 33 weeks. In the 2 minutes since I met her, I am certain: she is going to deliver a preterm baby very soon.   Our one-bed well-baby nursery is woefully unprepared to care for a 33 weeker.
60 seconds later, her contraction ends and she is snoring again (bless that man).  I swallow my moral outrage at checking an unconscious woman’s cervix, and find her to be 4cm dilated.
And, fucking breech.
(For those of you outside the OB world: Breech babies are NOT born vaginally. The risk of head entrapment is terrifying: the head is the biggest part of a baby’s body. This can quickly turn into dead baby hanging out of a vagina and that’s not a good look on anyone. So, any baby who is breech is universally born by c-section.)
Where were we?  Oh yeah: 33 weeks, breech, and psychotic with contractions.
As I jump up off the bed to start sounding the alarms, I see I now have a handful of meconium.
Not meconium-stained fluid… Frank meconium. From a frank breech baby who is now pooping into its mother’s vagina.
Now the score is up to: meth-induced preterm labor, breech, and meconium. This is the worst hat trick in the OB world. Fuck my life.
So, we start making plans to ship her out.  We gotta transport this train wreck to a facility that can care for a preterm baby.
I call the community on-call Dr. LaLa to report our hat trick, and after her telling me 8 different ways that we just need to c-section her and ship the baby, I say “well, why don’t you (STOP FUCKING TALKING AND) head in here, and we’ll have some more information when you get here.
In the background, volume 10: “I GOTTA PISS!!!!” I run back into the room to keep the patient from tearing her IV out as she barrels for the bathroom like a bull with its balls in a pinch. I also discover that she is dribbling copious amounts of undiluted meconium down her legs, has wiped it on the siderail, and has generally made a baby-poo finger painting out of everyone and everything in the room. Pretty sure I have some in my hair.
By the time Dr. LaLa waltzes in, it is clear to everyone on the unit that not only is this lady not going to stay pregnant long enough to make it to the helicopter, she isn’t going to stay pregnant long enough to make it into surgery. Also, she is almost completely unresponsive in between contractions and definitely cannot consent to surgery. Once Dr. LaLa catches up to speed on the very real mess that we’re all in, she says “Call Dr. Crusty, whatever happens - he can help.”
Oh great.   Good old Dr. Crusty. (we’ll get to how he earned that name later.)
Dr. Crusty has two states of being:

Look up the word “doddering” in the dictionary. His grinning face is the damn centerfold. It would be cute, if he wasn’t a surgeon. He dodders at everything. Walking, dictation, perineal repair, sharp dissection… I’ve seen him lacerate two babies’ faces in c-sections and yet still he is somehow in practice.  The OR techs give him the biggest needles they can find because he can't see the smaller ones.  He has a legit parkinsonian shuffle.  I could go on for days...
His other mode is: ""8 SEMI-CONFLICTING ORDERS AT ONCE! JESUS CHRIST YOU INCOMPETENT NITWITS MOVE FASTER!"" His trauma response is to become consummate prick with snide, passive-aggressive remarks about our nursing skills that everyone just lets slide because he’s delivered most of this rural area’s babies for the last 40 years.  He reminds us, constantly, how much experience he has, and how good he is at doctoring.  That said, he is actually amazing at some stuff, and will accept chickens and lawnmowing in payment for his services, so I am conflicted about talking shit about him.

Back to the scene:
We rush back to the operating room, and I scoop her onto the OR table between her wild contractions. Every 4 minutes, she becomes the Tasmanian Devil: writhing, howling, and grunting. I half-sprawl my body across hers to keep this tornado of a person from whirling right off onto the floor. Once one particular 60-second storm subsides - my dearest and actual most favorite anesthesiologist Dr. Diamond Rainbow pushes her mystical white light elixir of the gods into Taz’s IV.
We all felt a warm balm wash over us as the propofol solved quite a few of our problems.
With the Whirling Dervish asleep, we could turn our attention to more pressing things, like the half a baby butt peeking through this lady’s labia. (It was a girl, BTW. It was labia in labia. Labiaception for a minute.)
I love Dr. Diamond Rainbow with every fiber of my little nurse heart. She somehow waved her magic wand and settled this patient into a sweet peaceful place: somewhere between methamphetamine, Ativan, Haldol, Propofol, Versed, and Fentanyl…a delightful rainbow of medications…  Taz was able to sleep soundly, but keep her reflexes intact.
Maintaining just enough anesthesia for our Tasmanian Queen of Hawaii to protect her airway... meant she also retained the Ferguson Reflex.
For those of you who’ve never pushed a baby out: you know that feeling you get when you take a satisfying shit, your face contorts a little and your body goes into an animal hrrrrrrrrnnnggggg… and then you eject a pound and half of yesterday’s tacos? Yeah, that’s actually a reflex.  When you have a 5lb 10oz baby far enough down in your pelvis, your body knows just what to do with it.
Yeetus.  That.  Fetus.
So, the patient slept, and every 3 minutes would push quite effectively. I got to watch Dr. Crusty coach Dr. LaLa through a really lovely breech delivery. Out of hundreds of deliveries I’ve attended in 16 years as an L&D nurse - this is the third breech extraction I have ever witnessed.  Hat trick turned Triple Crown.  I felt like I was witnessing history, with that posterior shoulder delivery.
Oh yeah, back to Dr. Crusty.
I’m tucked in against the patient’s hip, feeling her belly for contractions with one hand, and searching with the doppler for heart tones with the other, when Dr. Crusty yells out “Puje!!! Puje!!!” Which is Spanish for “push”. Not only is the patient unconscious, she is Hawaiian, not hispanic. I turn to glare at him over the patient’s draped leg, and see through his goggles that he hasn’t wiped last night’s sleep crust off his face. I catch his squinting, yellow-crusted gaze and mumble “she can’t hear you, Dr. Crusty. And she doesn’t speak Spanish.”
All’s well that ends well - the baby is fine, actually 37 weeks. The patient slept it all off and then ate everything in the fridge. CPS will be in later today to take her baby (also meth+ on Utox) to foster care, but for now she gets to coo and giggle at her cute little daughter. I took her an 8th cup of coffee before I left, with 6 sugars and 4 creamers, just the way she likes it.
TL,DR: If a pregnant woman tells you she hurts anywhere between her nipples and her knees… it doesn’t matter how batshit insane she is.  Assume she is in labor, until proven otherwise.

I am tired of hearing well, ""if it's my time, it's my time"" and ""I am just going to live my life"" as well as ""my rights"" and ""my freedom"" only to have that person show up begging for help for something that could have been prevented. The vaccine is free and the studies are showing it is safe. But go ahead and have family and friends reach out to see about monoclonal antibody therapy and if they can get it for that. Why do you want to take that but wouldn't take the vaccine in the first place? I am tired of hearing religion is what saved a patient. No dear patient, it was the doctors and nurses who your deity sent to save you. Oh, and medical science.
I don't want to try to convince people anymore of things because the majority don't listen. I know I have helped a few people in my career, but the majority just want the ""quick fix"" and then continue what they were doing. Until my last shift, I am going to only give as much effort as the patient puts into their care. Don't believe Covid is real, well then here, please sign this DNR paperwork along with your discharge papers, so that when you show up needing all the help, we will have this on file. You don't want to prevent your own death by wearing a mask/social distancing/getting a vaccine then why in the hell should I waste my energy saving a life? It obviously wasn't that valuable to you in the first place. Or you thought it wouldn't happen to you. Nobody ever thinks something will happen to them until it does.
I am angry and disillusioned after all of this. There is no more left to give so I am leaving. Some will say that I ""signed up for this"" or that ""I shouldn't be allowed near patients"". That's nice. I didn't sign up to be told I am giving patients a virus because I swabbed their nose. I didn't sign up to be told that the internet search a patient just did knows more than me. As far as being allowed near patients, I am one of the nurses you want. I know how to care for you and what interventions you will need. I know what to look out for and when to call a doctor (as well as question an order if needed). You want the type of nurse I am to be around.
As for hospital administration...GO FUCK YOURSELF. With a 10"" dildo. Without lube.
Fuck your pizza parties.
Fuck your ""Heroes work here"" signs.
Fuck your hospital branded swag.
Hospital administration....pay your fucking staff. C-suite execs raking in huge bonuses while frontline staff risks their lives and families lives? Who in the hell do you think you are? You stayed in your vacation homes while we went to work and didn't get vacation. You got bonuses and we got a knife in the back disguised as a pat on the back. Come on down and hang out with me for a 12 hour shift and wear the same PPE for that period of time, as well as don't take a break to eat or pee. Your pansy asses won't make it past hour 3.
So to the internet trolls who are going to drag me.....bring it on from behind your screen. Not much you can do to hurt my feelings.
And to anyone who is worried about me, I have resources in place to take care of me, because I haven't put my needs first in a long time, and it's about time it fucking happens.
And to my nurses who are able to keep going, always remember, ""DO NO HARM BUT TAKE NO SHIT"".

It does give me warm fuzzies knowing there are like-minded people out there slogging it with me and rooting for HCWs as a whole. It’s late and I am tired after a few rounds in the ring. Let’s all get a good nights sleep! (And for my night shifters, may your coffee be strong and your haldol in stock!)
I have been a nurse for nine years now. I used to LOVE being a nurse. Now, I honestly hate people. 
Let’s paint a picture. I have a 95+ year old meemaw that’s going to be transferring into my unit from the ER. Confused, combative, and ripping out every line and tube placed all the while screaming “help me! You’re killing me!” She’s flinging poo everywhere and spitting. 
Oh, did I mention she has COVID? She’s also unvaccinated. 
Her family brought home COVID to her. I don’t see them running to come take care of her, or help us keep her life saving measurements in place. We are just expected to deal with it while understaffed and overwhelmed in a facility that is severely under serving this patient. We aren’t an appropriate facility to care for this patient but guess what? No beds in the community to transfer her to. 
I can say that in the past I would have felt horrible for this woman. Now, I have no compassion or empathy left. Fuck the people who got her sick. That I now have to deal with being spat on, clawed at, and risk getting COVID all because someone else was too selfish to stay the fuck home or away from their granny. 
I hate this virus. I hate that the general public doesn’t care about the healthcare system anymore. They are bitching that appointments are taking months to get. Welcome to the new norm of healthcare, where your selfishness of wanting to live your lives is overwhelming healthcare and burning out the few of us that are left.

You are correct, bravo, you’re literal interpretation is correct. But the actions they talk about have consequences and that is lower pay for nurses. Agencies take on all the risk, pay all payroll taxes, have overhead, etc. are they making more money than before? Probably if they are running their business correctly . Just like travel nurses  are making more money. There’s a reason that your social media, phones and emails are full of ads from travel company’s and it’s because they are competing to hire you because you are the limited resource. The hospitals set the bill rates, the agency finds the nurse and takes a cut, nurses works, both get paid .

31,2021-12-22T17:13:00+00:00,HaldolBlowdart,"Doc said ""good job fisting grandma""","ER. Typical day. Full waiting room, ambulances lining up, phones ringing, call buttons being mashed like a Tekken game. I stroll into my assigned pod at the beginning of my shift with an ambulance already rolling in, medics eager to hand off and skedaddle.
Sacral pressure ulcer, fever, worsening fatigue. Sepsis? Sepsis. Standard order for a contracted bedbound elderly woman with 3 day a week home care and daughter as primary caregiver. She says her booty hurts. I bet it does. We'll check it out in a second. First, it's time for the ER special of 2 IVs, an 18g in the forearm and a 22g in the knuckle, cultures, antibiotics, COVID swab, the donut of truth, and consult to literally everyone that's ever sneezed near the patient and has an MD after their name.
I grab the nearby fresh meat new grad nurse and say hey, it's time to clean grandma. Grandma finally had some pain meds and is in dilala land. Raul dutifully rolls contracted grandma, who doesn't notice because she's higher than the Wright brothers. Standard home care special, a dirty diaper that's saturated with urine, a few poop nuggets, a 3 inch stage 4 pressure ulcer I could stick my tiny fists in. Oh wait, what's that? A second ulcer? I see another large 4 inch hole just under the first sacral ulcer, but crusted with stool. A few nuggets must have escaped the booty and meandered on over to this second ulcer. I grab them with a bath wipe and gently remove the poop nuggets.
And then I realize that isn't a sacral ulcer. It's a booty hole. She has a fecal impaction. And that's her rectum, stretched out 4 inches wide and full of rock solid poop nuggets that she can't squeeze out. Raul, the poor baby nurse, realizes this right after I do. He looks horrified. I think he might leave nursing and go become a hermit.
Grandma is still high.
I sigh, and with a gloved hand pick at the poop nugget mass. It's formed like monkey bread, individual balls of poop smushed together by the force of her gaping asshole. It tears apart quite easily, much like the monkey bread it's shaped like. Grandma groans a bit. I peel away the surface nuggets, hoping it's all just there at the edge. It is not. I can see an inch into her rectal vault, the forbidden monkey bread staring at me, her rectum still gaping. How much is in there? I can't leave her like this. How does her rectum hold that gaping shape? How long has she been like this? It's possible to stretch that much?
I dig a bit deeper. It isn't a difficult task. Nugget after nugget is scooped out. Grandma says it feels better now. I keep scooping. My whole hand slips easily in without actually touching the walls of her intestines. I am wrist deep inside an elderly woman, making eye contact with a freshly minted nurse of just a few weeks, wishing I had finished my coffee before this so I could properly comprehend what was going on.
After an eternity, I've scooped what looks to me to be about a pound or more of stool out of grandma. It's a scale bed, so I weigh her after. 1.3 lb difference. She says she feels much better. I'm sure she does. Her butthole appears to be shrinking down to a normal size, but I'm still concerned.
The doctor comes back in to evaluate the pressure ulcer, since I told him to wait until I've cleaned her. He looks at me, direct eye contact.
""Good job fisting grandma.""
I'm offered a fist bump. I decline. I go finish my coffee, and wonder what the next 11 hours of my shift will bring. Raul avoids eye contact with me for awhile.
Merry Christmas, may your grandma not need to be fisted in the ER for a fecal impaction. And please, for the love of all things holy, give grandma a stool softener if she takes enough Percocet to make Future bat an eye. Otherwise she'll get disimpacted by an undercaffeinated ER nurse when trying to assess the pressure ulcer she acquired from family being too busy to turn her during the holidays.",5666,"459 comments",https://old.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/rm9seb/doc_said_good_job_fisting_grandma/,0.049,0.829,0.122,0.9956

It could not have gone worse. The first thing the visitor did was take off the patient's bipap mask cuz ""their nose was boogery."" This patient is altered already due to hypoxia, we had been having a rough day already keeping thier sats up. They've been on and off continuous bipap for a week, they're extremely sick. The nurse and the respiratory therapist had to stay in there for the duration of thier visit because they would NOT stop fucking with things in the room. Fiddling with knobs, pushing buttons, literally seemed like they were trying to kill the patient. I cannot stress how braindead these people were and how mad the nurse was.
This is a whole hot load of bullshit and it's conservative republicans fucking us over again, passing laws and bills for shit they will never understand.
Fun update; we have had multiple visitors through the day now, doctors and nurses alike have had to remind patients to keep their masks on while in the room. Even in a room with a covid positive patient, they WON'T WEAR THE MASKS. I am just done.
Re-wording; I did word the title kinda funky, I don't mean a visitor that is covid positive is being sent from the government.

She asks if I can wash her hair after the 5 millionth request and I just told her I would try to find time. She persisted, and I just told her that I had 5 patients (3 of them are on COVID isolation) and I have no tech and my charge nurse has a full load of patients because half the unit called off today. I told her my time is limited and I have to spend it doing the important things like bringing patients medications and assessing their heart and lungs. Doesn't matter, she's high as a kite on her ketamine and nothing is going to dissuade her from getting the full spa package. I straight up tell her no, I will not have time to wash her hair today, and she was welcome to call her sister or husband to ask if they had time to come by and help her.
So of course, patient advocacy calls my charge and says they wanted to complain about the nurse because I wouldn't wash her hair like I am not doing anything for her. Not making sure her pain is controlled while not being sedated, making sure she's hemodynamically stable, making sure she doesn't get an infection or a bedsore, making sure she doesn't develop post-op pneumonia, she isn't sitting in her own urine.

Coded multiple times in the field and transport, EEG shows minimal brain activity. No sedation, yet she remains unresponsive. I took her down to MRI for a final scan before a family meeting, and noticed she had an earring in when we got down there. 
I attempted to remove it, but was having a hard time. I went to grab gauze for better grip before I twisted it when the MRI tech yanked the whole thing out and left a bloody mess and hole in my patient’s ear. I was LIVID. I asked why she would do something like that, and that it was completely unnecessary. The thing that makes me even madder is that I showed her it could easily twist off. Just absolutely uncalled for. 
She responded with “She’s sedated anyway”. I almost lost it. Sedation does not mean they don’t feel PAIN or experience bodily trauma. It’s not an excuse to torture someone. I was soo mad, even the RT gave her lip too. 
I ended up telling my charge what happened, wrote a report, and took photos. I’m not sure if I was doing too much for an earring, but I felt like my pt was not respected at all. Anoxic or not, it doesn’t mean you torture their body.
Update!! I am floored by the amount of support from the community and I appreciate it. I somehow struggle with navigating whether I am doing the right thing and never am for confrontations and that is why I feel responsible/guilt.

Staffing is low, census is high, and acuity is ratcheting up. Despite this massive increase in workload, the benefits of many have been frozen. Pay has been cut. Raises have been put on indefinite suspension, and ETO has been gridlocked for months. In some specialties and settings, hours have been cut and even entire job roles have been eliminated leading to significant financial hardship for hundreds of thousands of nurses of all education levels around the world.
It's also been a challenging one for your moderators here at /r/nursing. Since February, this subreddit has at times become a bit of a lightning rod for a number of crackpots, covid deniers, and bad faith actors who are seeking to utilize this space as a megaphone for their ideas. To be clear, this isn't exactly brand new with the advent of the pandemic. This is a trend that we've been noticing for years. Anti-vaccination agendeers have been brigading our little corner of the internet for a lenghty period of time, and we have been quietly removing their content and banning repeat offenders for longer than we care to remember.
However, the pandemic has brought this issue to the forefront. As such, we've decided that it's time to enact a new subreddit rule to address the problem at hand. Going forth, we will be formalizing our stance on these issues. There will be no tolerating users who are attempting to spread anti-science information. More importantly, we will not allow those who wish to be willfully ignorant of reality to come here and abuse you for sport. Your jobs are hard enough as it is already.

45,2022-01-04T23:46:15+00:00,2cheeseburgerandamic,"I wrote down this story the day after it happened. It was too horrendous to ever forget, but I wanted to capture it right. To honor his life and death by helping people see what this looks and feels like","Denial. Anger. Negotiation. Depression/sorrow. Acceptance. The five stages of grief. I learned about them briefly in paramedic school. We studied it with more application specifics in nursing school. It was covered a little more in depth in psychology 101. I learned that it's not necessarily a linear process. People can bounce around through these stages, like a pinball, when severely strained. Regardless of what I know about it intellectually, as a critical care nurse, watching my patients and their family members go through it still can overwhelm me at times. Tonight was one of those nights.
The patient that I'm thinking of was a male in his upper 50s with a previous medical history of high blood pressure and high cholesterol. He was not vaccinated against Covid-19. The patient’s spouse had been diagnosed with Covid-19 about 10 days prior, and, of course, he ended up sick as well. He came to the hospital after about a week of persistent fevers with worsening shortness of breath. 
When he got to the emergency department, his blood oxygen percentage levels (SpO2) were found to be abysmal, in the 50-60% range. A normal range is 92-99%. This is one of the features of significant Covid-19 sickness: the surprisingly low SpO2 levels far exceeding the presenting symptoms. The patient was admitted to the ICU on continuous positive pressure ventilation given by a pressurized mask with straps going around his head to hold it onto his face. We call it AVAPS, although that is technically the name of the advanced setting being used. He stabilized pretty well on that, and his SpO2 levels improved up to the range of 93-97%. Eventually he only needed AVAPS some of the time, and was stable on a high flow nasal cannula otherwise. 
The patient and his wife had multiple conversations with the critical care doctor, and he adamantly did not want to be placed on a ventilator if it came to that. Per his instructions, we would do anything and everything to help him recover, but if he stopped breathing, or if his heart stopped, we would only do comfort measures. We would not perform CPR or place him on a breathing machine. In our state, this is called a DNR-CCA.
The first time I personally met him was his second day in ICU. I wasn’t his primary nurse, but he had put the call light on because the IV pump was beeping. We chatted for a bit while I fixed the problem, and he was pleasant, cooperative, and determined to get better. He looked uncomfortable, and I could tell that he wasn’t able to talk much because he still felt so short of breath. I smiled reassuringly as I told him that maybe he was over the hump, seeing as we had been able to make some progress on his oxygen requirements.
An hour or two later, I heard his monitor alarms going off, so I went to check on him. His SpO2 had started dropping precipitously due to the exertion of using a urinal, and his primary nurse and the respiratory therapist were rushing to place him back on the AVAPS machine. By the time they had the pressurized mask strapped in place, his oxygen levels hit 39% for a brief second until he started recovering. 
Because of the layers of PPE required to enter the room, I stood outside the room and played charades with the nurse and respiratory therapist to see if they needed me to bring anything. His work of breathing had increased, and he looked exhausted. The nurse had me get a dose of morphine to give him in his IV. I handed it to her quickly through the door when she cracked it open. 
Morphine dilates respiratory passageways and blood vessels to maximize oxygen absorption, and reduces pain and/or anxiety. Reducing pain and anxiety can help reduce how fast the body is using oxygen. The combination of these effects usually helps slow the breathing down and make them not feel so short of breath. 
After about 5-10 minutes, he was back to above 90%. His primary nurse came out of the room, and we talked about his “code status,” which is medical jargon for how to intervene in the case of respiratory or cardiac arrest. Had he been okay with it, we would have placed a breathing tube and put him on a ventilator at this point, but we were following his decision to have a DNR-CCA order. 
Over the next few hours, the patient required being on AVAPS continuously. He could no longer tolerate any breaks on the high flow nasal cannula. Eventually the respiratory therapist had to turn up the oxygen level and the pressure delivery on the AVAPS as high as they could safely be turned in order to keep the oxygen saturation above 90%. The heart rate was increasing from the strain on his body.
I started noticing frequent alarms from that room, alarms for high heart rate, low oxygen saturation, or high respiratory rate. The patient had to focus on slow and deep breathing to recover, which usually took several minutes. These alarms started sounding more frequently. First it was every half hour, then every 15 minutes, then every 5 minutes, and then it was almost constantly. At this point, he was nearly unable to recover into the SpO2 safe zone.
With an hour left to go in my shift, I saw that the patient's SpO2 had fallen below 80% and wasn't coming up. I also knew that his AVAPS system was maxed out. There was nothing more that could be done from an oxygen delivery standpoint. I went to the room, along with the primary nurse, the critical care nurse practitioner and respiratory therapist. His breathing had become more and more labored. His respiratory effort now consumed him to the point that he was unable to speak. We gave morphine for air hunger several times with minimal effect. 
We called the family on an iPad video chat so they could see and talk to the patient. They didn't understand how critical this was, and started teasing him a little ""Come on, I didn't think you'd let a little virus like this push you around! We're all praying for you. Everyone in the church is praying, you're going to be okay. You need to kick this little bug’s butt!"" 
The patient initially gave a few slight nods to their comments, to let them know that he heard them, but otherwise sat there with his undivided attention on trying to breathe. His respiratory rate was around 40 really deep breaths per minute (normal is 15-20 regular breaths). Even though it was obvious to us that he could not sustain this respiratory effort for long, and that we had no way of stopping this runaway train, they tried to act cheerful and positive. 
Denial.
Within 5-10 minutes, the patient had reached a point of absolute maximum effort, and had begun truly gasping for air. His shoulders and belly were heaving. Every single breath was a fight for survival, a panicked drowning victim frantically swimming with futility, unable to reach the surface of the water. We could hear him grunting with effort for every breath, the sound muffled by the pressurized mask strapped to his face. His skin became cold and grey, covered with a sheen of sweat. The SpO2 levels now stayed below 70%. 
The staff in the room looked at each other with grim certainty in our eyes. There was no turning back. There was no recovery from this. The virus had won. It had shredded his lungs beyond function to the point that his body was shutting down. 
His family asked why we can’t place him on a ventilator. The nurse practitioner explained that, aside from him specifically asking us not to, with the damage that had been done, it would only serve to prolong his dying and make him suffer longer. They asked what else we could do, what medications we could give, or how we can stop this. We told them that we had used every tool in the toolbox to help him get better already. There was nothing else to use. 
Negotiation.
The family scrambled to get the children on the phone. They kept saying ""It's going to be okay! Everything is going to be fine. You'll get through this!"" But the tone of their voice had changed. They went from trying to talk to the patient into laughing with them, to trying to reassure him, to begging and pleading with him to stay alive, to utter despair. We gave him some more morphine, as well as some lorazepam for anxiety.
Keeping the patient alive in this condition was only cruel. Keeping the pressure mask on his face was simply prolonging the inevitable. The patient's eyes were rolling back in his head. There was no longer any sign of interaction. The only movement now was his body trying desperately to somehow draw in more oxygen to stay alive, and failing. We explained to the family that the compassionate thing to do would be to take him off AVAPS and see if he can say anything to them. 
More of the children got on the video call. One son could only handle it for about 30 seconds before he hung up, overwhelmed with the stark cold reality of mortality starting him in the face.  Seeing the patient, not only dying, but dying by prolonged suffocating, was horrific. We gave several large doses of morphine to provide what comfort we could, and slow the breathing down a little. We took off the pressure mask, and placed a high powered nasal cannula at its highest settings. 
The family could really see his face now, and their voices changed to utter terrified agony. The sound of gasping grunting breathing was no longer muffled by the pressure mask. No words were going to come out of his mouth. Only the haunting sounds of a dying man. The nurse practitioner held one hand while the respiratory therapist held the other. 
The spouse started crying hysterically, shouting with a surprising fury in her voice: ""NO! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO US. IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE THIS! WE WERE SUPPOSED TO GROW OLD TOGETHER! WE WERE SUPPOSED TO SIT ON THE PORCH IN OUR ROCKING CHAIRS! YOU CAN'T LEAVE US! YOU CAN'T LEAVE YOUR GRANDBABIES! PLEASE, GOD, PLEASE, NO! WE LOVE YOU!"" 
Anger. 
We all quietly glanced at each other, and more morphine was given, along with more lorazepam. The rawness of the suffering being experienced by both the patient and the family sucker punched me in the gut. My focus on documentation, patient care, and support of the team swept to the side for a moment, and tears slipped out of my eyes and ran down onto the N95 mask under my face shield. My isolation gown and gloves felt like a sauna as I tried to keep my emotional composure. The pain of the family sucked at my soul. 
In medicine, death is usually our mortal enemy. The dark robed nemesis with a scythe who we fight at every turn. We spend billions of dollars a year in an eternal war against him with our patients. But death was now a white angel of mercy, the one who could bring peace into this torment and end this suffering. God, please let him die soon.
The wife stopped shouting, and her words became less aggressive, but filled with soul-wrenching tears of genuine sadness. She sobbed as she said ""This isn’t fair. It’s too soon. You weren’t supposed to go like this. You are too strong! You were supposed to be there when your grand daughter grows up and gets married. I don’t know how to live without you."" 
Depression/sorrow. 
The breathing started becoming sporadic, still gasping, but with less movement as the body lost all of its strength. Only the shoulders really moved now, heaving upwards for a few deep grunting breaths, then pausing for a few seconds. 
The reflexive task of breathing that started when the patient burst from the womb as a newborn had continued unabated through every minute of their life until now. A 2 second pause. A 5 second pause. A 10 second pause. The oxygen levels dropped below 30%. The heart rate began slowing. The children all hung up on the video call until only the spouse was left. “It’s okay, baby. It's going to be okay. We love you. God loves you. We’ll be strong. We’ll be okay. God, help us be okay.” 
Acceptance
We stood there, holding the patient's hands as all effort to breath stopped. I quietly turned off the monitor alarms. The spouse was still talking to the patient, just saying sentences that had become meaningless filler, background noise more for the spouse than for him. We stepped back from the patient as the NP performed a quick pronouncement exam. He turned towards the iPad screen, made eye contact with the spouse, and simply stated, ""he’s gone.""
The grief, shock, and terror hit the spouse like a fresh ice cold wave of pain. In spite of the obvious inevitably of this moment for the last 45 minutes, she sounded truly surprised that it came. There were no more words. Just despondent heart wrenching wails of emotion. Raw inhumane pain.
The staff whispered quietly to each other, and we agreed to leave them alone at this time. We spoke our condolences to the wife, and then walked out of the room, peeling off our layers of PPE. The primary nurse thanked me for my help. I glanced back into the room as I walked away. A cold grey lifeless body sitting in bed illuminated by the cold blue glow of the iPad on the stand next to them.
I hustled to get back to my patients for the last 10 minutes of my shift. My Covid patient in his mid 60s had comfortably worn his AVAPS all night, and was wearing just a little bit of oxygen by  regular nasal cannula now that he was awake and sitting up. I smiled as I told him that maybe he was over the hump, seeing as we had been able to make some progress on his oxygen requirements. He would probably leave the ICU today unless something drastically changed.  I gave him a couple medications.
I checked in on my Covid patient in his mid 30s. He was actually looking a little worse, his breathing had increased from a normal 20 to 25 breaths a minute to 30 to 35 breaths a minute, and looking a little anxious. We had been able to turn down the oxygen level on his high flow nasal cannula throughout the night, however. He told me that he's just having a lot of coughing with pleuritic chest pain, that he thinks he'll be fine. I wished him well and ducked back out of the room to give the end of shift report. 
I wish for a lot of things. I wish that we would all never take a single day for granted.  I wish we would all hold those we love a little closer tonight. I wish Covid wasn't still killing people daily. I wish that everyone could empathize with the grief that we all felt tonight. I wish that we could all learn to love each other a little more while we have time.",4459,"464 comments",https://old.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/rw8a8f/i_wrote_down_this_story_the_day_after_it_happened/,0.114,0.75,0.136,0.9972

Hi!  Lemme address our loving and adoring fans who last year were mocking us and then this year are cherry-picking ""heroes"" because they allowed themselves to lose their jobs because of political beliefs...which literally fucked over their coworkers and patients in a time of crisis staffing levels. (But really, we've always been at crisis staffing levels, amirite?)

The vaccines are gene therapy 

mRNA vaccines are not gene therapy. They cannot change your DNA. For starters, they cannot access the nucleus due to issues pertaining to the size of mRNA molecules and they basically lack the keycard to gain entrance. We evolved that cellular defense in order to make sure we don't die due to simple bacterial and viral infections. 
Even if mRNA could enter the nucleus, it lacks two enzymes that are required to become part of DNA. It would require reverse transcriptase in order to even be prepared in the format to be inserted and it would need integrase in order for that insertion to happen. 
Since those three things don't happen, it's not gene therapy. What happens is the mRNA is consumed after being used to create a limited number of proteins for immune identification purposes and the mRNA is turned into nucleotides which already exist within the cellular environment to be turned into other things.

The vaccines are used for tracking purposes 

If you carry your cell phone on you 24/7, then they don't need covert nanotechnology to achieve this. 

More vaccinated people are being hospitalized than unvaccinated people.

This is just flat out false. Both my own personal experiences of operating in COVID environments and evidentiary studies absolutely do not support the assertion that more vaccinated individuals are being hospitalized than unvaccinated, especially within the US.

The vaccine makes people sick with COVID 

For starters, it can't. The mRNA vaccines lack the components required to do that. People might experience some side effects related to the vaccine, but they're not contracting COVID and those side effects are no where near as severe or as lasting as the effects of COVID themselves.

COVID has a survival rate of [insert random fake number] 

The mortality rate of COVID in the US is around 2%. That mortality rate exist within a context of a healthcare system and infrastructure that are intact. We are not suffering from a lack of critical supplies; although, we do have a lack of adequate staffing around the country.  To that point, 2% is not really a low number. We usually count disease mortality in deaths per tens or hundreds of thousands. With COVID, it's deaths per hundred. That's kind of high, especially with the ease of which the virus can transmit/infect. That R0 is kind of important for that reason. Low mortality rates plus high rate of infectivity still result in large losses of life. Imagine if 2% of the US population (340ish million) were to die off.
In places where there was a collapse in the ability to effectively provide care, we were seeing mortality rates as high as 12-15%. This was the reality for Italy at the very beginning of the pandemic where they were not only losing patients, but they were also losing healthcare providers. 
Additionally, COVID mortalities aren't just about coronavirus, but the situation where people who need care for other things are unable to access those resources because they are used up by COVID patients. This means no ICU availability for everything from stroke patients, to heart attack patients, and trauma patients. It's not a simple ""Covid vs No Covid"" issue.
Lastly, death isn't the only negative outcome for patients. We are seeing a significant number of people with long-term disability and prolonged recovery times after COVID infection.

They are pushing experimental vaccines when they should be pushing monoclonal antibody therapy. It's just to profit large pharmaceutical companies.

Eli Lilly (Bamlanivimab/Etesevimab) and Regeneron (Casirivimab/Imdevimab) are in the same business as Pfizer, Moderna, Merck, Oxford AstraZenica...etc. In fact, go look at their share prices on the stock market.
But furthermore, the antibody therapies are way more experimental than the vaccines are. Also, they function in similar ways (kind of). With a vaccine, you make your own antibodies that are later used to fight infection. With monoclonal antibodies, antibodies are created in a laboratory setting and then are given to COVID patients to fight infection after getting sick. One is preventative, the other is not. 
The vaccines have been through clinical trials which have been way more expansive and involved significantly more people in comparison to monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of COVID.

hospitals are paid to kill covid patients and that's why they won't do X and Y and Z flavor of the month treatment.

Even if we look at this from a purely economical standpoint, killing patients is bad for business. If the goal is to generate money, it would make more sense to keep your patients sick for a longer period of time and run up the bill. Patient deaths put a very final ending to the ability to bill patients...also, there are limits to the ways in which a healthcare institution can collect from an estate of a deceased individual.

Well obviously they are keeping the patients sicker longer by not administering [insert random ineffective medication or vitamin supplement or rectal sunshine here]

All of the medications being talked about are unapproved and have shown limited to no effectiveness in the treatment of COVID. And while I know you're going to cite the very few studies that show Ivermectin works, I'm going to point out that those are in vitro and the dosage in order to have an antiviral effect are well beyond the dose where you start seeing toxic effects. The safe doses are consistently proven to do absolutely nothing.
What we do know is that there are absolutely effective treatments that range from vaccination (preventative), the use of monoclonal antibodies, convalescent plasma (to a point), and various cocktails of steroids, antibiotics (combat opportunistic infections), and antivirals.
All of these things act in ways to prevent hospitalization, shorten admissions, and keep people out of the ICU. We know this, because it's the reality on the ground. There's very little evidence, if any at all, that proves otherwise.

The vaccines were created too fast 

A lot of the timing of FDA approval and creation of novel medications has less to do with safety testing and more to do with things like building up funding, access to resources, building up clinical trial volunteers, and then the longest part...waiting for it to be reviewed which takes forever. In fact, it historically took so long that Congress passed multiple laws in history to hire more people to review applications because that created the largest bottleneck...and it still does.
During coronavirus, we had probably one of the largest incidences of international scientific cooperation in the history of mankind. The funding was immediately available, access to research space and resources was immediately available, clinical trial participants were immediately available, and the wealth of information being generate was being shared around the world rapidly. This cut down on so much of the time that's usually spent waiting for things to move forward. Imagine is science was so well funded and able to access critical resources all the time...

We don't know what the long-term effects of the vaccines are. People are going to being dropping dead in 2 years. 

We actually do know an awful lot about how vaccines work, even the mRNA vaccines. In general, if you haven't seen adverse effects of that nature within 12 weeks, you're not going to see them when it comes to vaccines. For the hundreds of years we've been researching and administering vaccines, this has generally held true. There's no evidence that there will be some magical change to this.

Vaccines are killing people  

I'll paraphrase Jerry McGuire. Show me the bodies. 
Over 3.7B people in the world have received at least 1 dose of a vaccine related to COVID. There's no evidence of a massive die-off due to vaccination. None. In fact, even if the highest fictitious number that's frequently cited were true, it's still dwarfed by the fact that 4.6M people have died globally due to COVID.

Masks aren't effective, they don't work.  

We know that masks work. 

The virus is too small for the masks. Also, masking causes carbon dioxide to be trapped and leads to hypoxia 

Coronaviruses have an approximate diameter of 0.1μm
Oxygen has an approximate diameter of 0.000346μm
Carbon dioxide has an approximate diameter of 0.00033μm  
If masks cannot stop the passage of coronaviruses, then they sure as fuck can't trap Oxygen or Carbon Dioxide molecules. 
Also, just for the record, you aren't attempting to stop virions with your average surgical mask. You're attempting to stop droplets and droplet nuclei which are how most viruses get around. Those are significantly larger than viruses themselves are are absolutely caught by your average mask.

But VAERS said...

VAERS is a reporting tool, nothing more. It does not confirm claims, it only compiles them and ANYBODY can submit a report. There are instances of people reporting themselves as dead. What VAERS says is entirely meaningless in the discussion 

The mandates are just like Nazis and the Holocaust. This is how it starts. 

First off, as a Jewish descendant of people that just barely survived, eat my whole ass. 
Second, no. The NSDAP actually RELAXED vaccine regulations that existed since the mid-to-late 1800s when the Prussian government responded to a smallpox outbreak that killed tens of thousands of people.  It's was a central point of the German health plan at the time that lasted for nearly 50 years.
The NSDAP used propaganda to scare people into supporting the end of vaccine regulations because they believed that ""the smart Germans"" would still get vaccinated and the immigrants and social undesirables would just die off of disease because they would be intellectually too inferior to realize they needed vaccines. They also made it harder for ""non-Germans"" to access medical care. 
So no...these mandates are nothing like the NSDAP; however, pushing against vaccination and using propaganda to eliminate vaccination...kinda is like the NSDAP. Hrm...

Well, it's my choice, what happened to freedom? Don't you believe in freedom? 

Of course I do. But we exist in a world where our freedoms intersect with the freedoms of others. You are free to not be vaccinated, but private entities are also free to decide how to respond to that. That is also true for the use of masks and other non-pharmacological interventions to assist in putting a stop to a viral pandemic. 
You're free to make those choices, but you're not free from the consequences of those choices. Some consequences are positive, others are less positive.

If we get sick or die from a preventable disease then we have failed our promise to the public. 
It is dangerous for us and the profession to frame our work in terms of war. Our enemy is a string of RNA who cares nothing about our country or politics. Wars are political. Pandemics are science.

The outgoing RN gives report on an ETOH detox who got sent from an outpatient rehab facility. Patient's been bothering everyone who walks by, agitated, asking for meds and food, vomits whenever he talks someone into giving him something to drink. Outgoing nurse just goes on about how he's just a demanding asshole. I ask about most recent meds, he hasn't had any due to scored CIWA's of 4 to 7 by her through the morning.
I get her out of there, head straight over and look at the patient. Visible tremors, sweaty, call his name and see him jump (startles easily) ask some questions and he endorses headache, pins and needles sensation and visual hallucinations. He's also a bit off on the date. I score him a 21. Of course he's a demanding asshole - HE'S IN WITHDRAWL. I give him 3mg IV ativan per protocol, IV zofran for the nausea. 30 minutes later I get a 15, so he gets another 1mg IV ativan. Hour later he's an 8 so I give him some oral pain meds and then he slept for the next two hours. Woke up at a 7, ate a meal without puking. Pleasant as can be.
People, don't punish patients in your care with induced acute withdrawl. It's not the time.

So yesterday prominent Q anon / anti vax nut job Cirsten Weldon (public personality) died of Covid (because of course she did).
Her crazy Q compatriots have of course immediately decided she didn’t really die from Covid, and this is actually a big conspiracy by the hospitals to intentionally kill people. They blame the hospital for refusing Ivermectin, and overall murdering her. 
They’re advocating for rounding up doctors and nurses and charging them with murder, as well as committing physical violence against them, and even hanging them. 
This dude in particular is extremely militant. The first 10 minutes of this video are absolutely bonkers reaction to Cirsten’s death. https://youtu.be/Yr5c2R45TuU
He’s talking about how they’ve been sneaking Ivermectin into hospitals to give to patients. They apparently tried this with Cirsten. He’s also saying that all healthcare workers should be tried for murder.
In the wake of Cirsten’s death another one of their friends, Q public personality Scott McCay, is physically threatening to dox the nurses who worked on Cirsten, encouraging violence against all hospital workers, and advocating for their execution. He’s calling for all out war against healthcare employees.

It is a select group of people, but it is enough to cause quite the ruckus. They said we are carrying out murder/death policies. They said we are being compensated for killing people and administering remdesivir. They said we are forcing people to be on a ventilator because it kills these patients. They said they want to take control of the hospital and force us to ""actually treat"" patients.
Meanwhile I spent my entire shift in an n95 trying to stabilize a dying patient maxed out on vent settings, yet still keeping sats below 70%. Couldn't titrate pressors fast enough. Couldn't sedate enough. Couldn't bring down the fever. Nothing lowered his heart rate below 145. Nothing we threw at this patient touched him. We were playing a waiting game for him to code. I wouldn't be surprised if he is dead now.
I'm the death squad though.
I spent whatever time not in the dying person's room trying to help my other patient understand the treatment options for COVID, assess why he didn't get vaccinated, why he was refusing the only treatments we know to show some benefit, and giving him the option to not be intubated. I wanted him to fully understand the treatments we were offering, and if he continues to refuse that's fine, but I'm not offering anything that will cause harm. I specifically said the refusal to be intubated is 100% your choice, and yes we do find that intubated people don't do well.. because they are already that sick, not because the breathing tube kills them. 
I'm ""enforcing death policies"" though.
Like.... I can't with these people. The narratives they keep coming up with are just mind blowing and truly show the lack of knowledge we are dealing with. Honestly it is almost humerous at this point. On the plus side, we're getting bonus pay now. 🤷‍♀️ That counts for something right?

Current ER nurse in one of the largest hospitals in my region, level 1 trauma, all that. We take folks in from all the surrounding rural areas in addition to our urban population. It doesn’t matter where they come from, it seems lately the only people we take care of are the most entitled jerks you could imagine. There are few patients or families lately that I think to myself “I’ve really enjoyed being able to take care of these folks.” This is not who I wanted to be when I started as a nurse. It is not who I want to be as I continue to be a nurse. But I’m so fucking exhausted and worn down.
COVID didn’t wear me down. I’ve practiced this profession for just over 2 years. That is not very long to practice nursing. However, the current state of affairs forced all of us new grads at the start of the pandemic to learn faster than ever. I became a good nurse during COVID, often because of the myriad of complications caused by the virus, and the criticality forced onto us due to it. I’ve seen the pandemic force all of us who are new to grow up quickly. In the ER, we’ve dealt with the very “frontest” of front lines and the quagmire of initial stabilization of the population. It’s tiring, but COVID itself has not been what has made me question this career.
People have. The fucking people are wearing me down. 
What has worn me down is the incredible selfishness, ignorance, arrogance, and stupidity of a sizeable chunk of humanity. As people did what they were supposed to do, our hospital has filled up with the ones who didn’t. So the population is skewed already towards the assholes, and thanks to long hospital stays in the ER we hold said assholes and then try to keep actual ER patients safe in our triage/waiting room. Most days I’m way more of an ICU nurse than ER at this point. 
I did not want to be an ICU nurse. Hence why I applied to work in an ER.
I swear to God one of the most surreal experiences I’ve had for a long time is a woman berating us due to us not having a warmed blanket for her 1 minute, to requiring comfort because “please I don’t want to die.” Followed by the next minute cussing us out for trying to get her to put the BIPAP mask on because she was so acidic it’s a miracle she wasn’t actively dissolving. 
Meanwhile one door down someone who actively refuses to take care of their diabetes demands their third sandwich of the hour and gets pissy they had to wait to get it. 
He had to wait cause we had to call a Code Blue on someone, who this patient actively saw us compressing on when we wheeled him by that patient’s room so we could intubate in a front room. But no, sandwich boy needs his fucking 3rd sandwich now god dammit!
It used to be you’d get some asshole ER patients, and could roll with it pretty easily. It’s the ER, folks aren’t having good days when they come to us. Now? Just replaced by the next belligerent asshole expecting us to risk our lives so they can die on a fucking hill.
During all of this shitstorm, we are still getting all of our strokes, STEMI’s, traumas, overdoses, and children who we code because asthma closed their airway and I hear the mother’s screams when I walk into the room days after the code.
We use dark humor to cope with the unrelenting cascade of horror and pain and abuse and exhaustion. But inside, my heart is breaking knowing that the mother who, in her vulnerable moments, told me she doesn’t want to miss her daughter graduating high school. My heart breaks because I know as I strap the BIPAP mask back on that this woman will die in the ICU. My heart breaks because I’m don’t know which will be worse for her daughter. Knowing mama died, or knowing mama didn’t have to die? My blood boils as I type this because of the selfishness of this mother to not get vaccinated. She won’t have to live with those consequences, at least not for long. Her daughter on the other hand? A lifetime without her mother seems a steep price to pay just to stick it to those dirty Liberals. And the person who incurred the debt will not be the one to pay it. The injustice is sickening.
This job has convinced me that I really hate a lot of people. COVID did not do that. It was merely the catalyst by which so many people have shown who they truly are.

I'm an LPN and about 50% of my job is doing phone triage. I primarily work in pediatrics so most of my calls are fairly mild (breastfeeding and formula questions, medication refills, reiterating home care instructions, scheduling urgent appts, etc.). Even though I haven't suffered anywhere near the amount that many of you have, this last year has certainly taken its toll. 
A patient's mother called to schedule a symptom based appt. No big deal right? Wrong. After some prying I find out that this fucking idiot has been giving her toddler ivermectin because she started to have mild cold symptoms and they were worried it may be covid (mind you, nobody in the family is vaccinated and nobody has been tested). She's absolutely showing signs of toxicity. I immediately told the mom she needs to call 911 and this dumbass has the audacity to tell me she doesn't need to go to the ER she just needs to see a doctor in the clinic. It took everything in me to not scream at her. I kept her on the line while I dialed 911 for her and provided them with her address. A police officer spoke with me and my attending and reassured us that parents cannot decline medical care because it's suspected abuse and she will be seen in the ER no matter what. CPS report is in the works and I'm sure one will be done by hospital staff as well. 
I just can't fucking believe some people. Our antivax or vaccine hesitant parents can annoy me quite a bit, but literally poisoning your child with medication made for farm animals is a whole different ball game. And I'm pregnant, so of course I'm extra upset and can't help but cry every time I think about it. I hope they never get their child back.

The other day I received a patient at shift change, chief complaint joint pain/decreased mobility, also COVID + of course. Full work up, no resp distress, cleared by internal medicine, set for discharge. Wonderful, I’m happy to clear a bed. I go into the room and start talking logistics with her.
Can someone come pick her up? 
No, she can’t get into a car (large lady, plus low mobility, actually her mobility has been decreasing since early December actually.) 
Okay, ambulance transfer home then, how do you get around at home? who can come look in on you?
She can’t get around at home, No one to look in on her, small support system already, and with COVID she can’t ask that of anyone. 
I felt my frustration. I don’t have time for this, this isn’t my job to sort this lady’s life out, we have 8 trucks to unload and a jam packed waiting room. But at the end of the day, I know beyond a shadow of a doubt this lady can’t go home, she’ll just fall and get hurt worse than she is. I tell her MRP and she gets admitted. I go in again to set her vitals to cycle, a new canister for her purwick and I notice she’s still got her socks on. (Always take the socks off, please please.) I cross my fingers and take them off. Nothing horrific, but dry split skin, old blood, and over grown nails. I ask her about how she cleans at home, and find out she’s only had a sponge bath since December, hasn’t been able to get in the shower. I sighed, and rang the call bell.
My coworker comes to the door and I request a full bath kit, a roll of intradry, a couple of barrier creams and a fresh set of sheets. I spend the next 20 minutes scrubbing every surface, got her up out of bed (very unsteady, reaffirmed she needed to stay in hospital) I get her freshly gowned, intradry layered into each fold to allow her skin to heal. And I work down to her feet and I wash between her toes. She comments on how nice it feels to be clean. And for a moment I remember. When I was a floor nurse I used to gauge a good day by if I got enough time to clean between the toes. Basic care that shouldn’t get missed but it does all the time. Repositioned, fresh warm blanket and a cup of ice chips. I’m in the room very infrequently for the rest of the shift, but I tell her goodbye when I bring her supper tray in. 
Two shifts later I pop into the room to grab a thermometer. I didn’t even realize it was still her, 48 hours into her admission still waiting on a bed upstairs. She lights up and greets me by name. She’s had at least 4 nurses since me, but not a moment of hesitation. We chatted for just a few minutes but it felt good. I stepped out feeling like I actually made a difference again.

I work in a respiratory ICU. We are running low on the RECOMMENDED personal protective equipment that we should be wearing to take care of these incredibly sick patients. We are starting to be told to use surgical masks unless doing a procedure which will aerosolize droplets, which were previously advised as not acceptable for caring for these patients. 
When I get off shift, I can’t even get the basic items I need because stores are completely empty or I have to stand in line for over an hour in order to get in anywhere to buy groceries. 
I’m now reading about nurses being attacked because people think they are “spreading the virus.” FUCKING EXCUSE ME. Y’all need to chill. 
These healthcare workers are saving your lives and the lives of your loved ones. Putting their lives at risk of being exposed everyday without the proper equipment, being told we can only be tested if we have symptoms because we have limited testing available, limiting contact and time with our families to keep them safe, and still showing up to work to take care of you. 
I recognize and have accepted that our healthcare system and government are incredibly broken and unprepared to handle a pandemic of this proportion. So it’s NOT the fault of the general population
But I’m begging you all to do what you can in your daily lives to make it easier on one another. 
I understand this is a time of uncertainty and it’s fucking scary but please please practice mindfulness. Be kind to one another and think about how your actions could affect others before you go panic buying every meat product, toilet paper roll, and bottle of hand sanitizer off the shelves.
EDIT: thank you to everyone who took the time to respond, share your thoughts, concerns, or frustrations, and to open up discussion about this topic. I’ve read each and every comment and my heart goes out to all of you. I wish I didn’t have to say this but my post states “healthcare workers” which includes everyone who is involved in direct patient care - including MAs, CNAs, lab techs, physicians, etc - who should have access to proper protective equipment and proper testing. Someone mentioned reaching out to your government representatives and union reps (if you have one) and this is a great place to start. We need to demand better now and in the future. Stay safe, wash your hands, and do something kind for someone in your life! We are all trying to handle this crazy curveball we’ve been thrown as best we can.

However, I’m allowed to be upset and frustrated with the situation that we are in now. It’s an all around awful situation - hospitals were not prepared with a back stock of PPE, our testing availability and turn around time is far too limited and takes too long, and nobody was prepared for the amount of critically ill people that are going to need care. What I’m asking again is for people to think about what you’re doing and how it might affect other people. I’ve read shitty stories about racism, price gouging, and people losing their jobs. I’ve also read stories of incredible kindness and empathy - people going grocery shopping for their elderly or at risk neighbors, landlords waiving rent for people who have become unemployed or taken huge pay cuts, and people offering to 3D print pieces for hospitals.

69,2021-11-06T12:51:02+00:00,naga5497,"I'm so sick of being attacked with unfair covid vaccine questions as though it is ""just a discussion"".","I joined my sister and a small group of her coworkers for a night in with casual drinks and cards. I thought they were all vaccinated and I knew most of them from other gatherings, but there was one new guy. Turns out he is antivax. The topic of vaccines came up after it had been established that I am a new ICU nurse (and well before we had very much to drink). 
He kept firing questions at me as though I spoke for all of health care, and as though I had personally passed all the legislation for covid vaccines in my country. Some of them were openly inflammatory, such as, ""Well, why haven't they just built more ventilators for the ICUs, they've had years to do it now!"" I didn't want to bluntly tell my sister's coworker to shut up or that he was blatantly wrong, so I sort of slipped into the ""customer service"" voice I use at work and gave calm, diplomatic answers. I guess that was a mistake, because he just kept going. I never asked a single question, it was just him asking really ignorant stuff and me calmly answering and subtly trying to reinforce that I was only one person and I couldn't speak for all of science. Other people in the group looked visibly annoyed/uncomfortable but didn't say anything. A few people chimed in with just complete bs ""statistics"" and I once again didn't blatantly disagree but tried to provide a new perspective as an ICU nurse. The original guy accused nurses of denying unvaccinated patients the same quality of care as vaccinated patients. My sister and another coworker finally spoke up to ""end the discussion"" and made me feel as though both of us were speaking out of turn, when I had just been providing really general, noninflammatory information. Trust me, I've gotten good at hiding my annoyance during these discussions.
It turns out many of them felt that it was unfair for the covid vaccine to be mandatory in their workplace, and were offended when I said, ""Everyone's opinion is going to be shaped by their own experiences. In my experience, I work with a bunch of vaccinated nurses that never had side effects from the vaccine, and so far this wave I have only treated unvaccinated people for covid in the icu. They are bedbound, sedated, paralyzed... no major comorbidities and much younger than the previous wave. I guess I am happy the vaccine is mandatory because we haven't had to turn anyone away because we were out of rooms or ventilators. So, yeah, I think it's a good idea for people to be vaccinated.""
I know, I know, I should have just said, ""we need to agree to disagree"" and left it... but still, why do people act as though someone basically attacking me and my profession is a two-way ""discussion"" and not lowkey harassment? Why does my existence spark argument? Do I need to hide my job from others?

He was healthy, active, and didn't even fucking smoke.  A young beautiful wife my age, two adorable kids, and a business he did with his dad.  A whole family that was loving and involved. 
He wasn't vaccinated and when he got covid he just tanked so hard and fast we had to put him on ECMO.   When he'd cough through the paralytics it would take him 3 days to recover his O2.  He had a MASSIVE clot in his heart that kept breaking down and reforming, clogging the ECMO and causing a panic multiple times a day.
I played his pandora playlist for him and jammed out to his rock and metal songs.  I trimmed his mustache and beard so it wouldnt get tickled on the ventilator.  Early on when trialing him off paralytics was an option he would begin to wake up, biting on the vent and opening his eyes.  He would look so scared, tears in his eyes.  His panic would be so bad it would chatter out ecmo and tank his pressure.  But I would cup his face with my hand and rub my thumb on his cheek and tell him he was safe, he was getting better everyday, and that I was right here with him.  Whenever I did this he would relax in my arms and let his eyes close.  I've never had children but I imagine the feeling is similar, I just wanted to protect him.
I wanted him to beat the statistics and the facts.  I wanted him to be one of the miracle cases so bad that I fully heartedly and aggressively wanted to do everything possible.  Because if we can't even save a healthy 30yo then who is all this for?  
We had to switch him to V/A ECMO to get him ready to fly to another state for a lung transplant.  The Catheter punctured through his heart and he went over an hour hypoxic till they fixed it.  I watched them in tears, covered in blood and debating desperately with angry eyes behind masks and shields.  They decided to compassionately withdraw care.  Within the hour the wife and family was at his side and I had to hear one more spouse screaming from behind the sliding doors.
We let him die and I helped undress the family while the nurse bagged and tagged.  A family member asked the wife if she was going to get vaccinated now and she said ""no, I have faith.""

72,2021-08-22T21:51:00+00:00,Nursesharky,"Today the New York Times wrote a front page article on the ""nursing shortage."" They chose to interview one staff nurse and EIGHT healthcare executives and researchers. I have compiled the most insulting quotes below:","https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/21/health/covid-nursing-shortage-delta.html

Ms. Foster [COO] sighed when asked whether the hospital offered signing bonuses. The best she can do is pass out goody bags filled with gum, bottled water and a letter of appreciation that includes online resources for those overwhelmed by the stress of the past few weeks.

Did the New York Times ask how much Ms. Foster she is being paid for her services assembling goodie bags and having meetings over Zoom? Of course not.

The coronavirus pandemic has stretched the nation’s nurses as never before, testing their skills and stamina as desperately ill patients with a poorly understood malady flooded emergency rooms. They remained steadfast amid a calamitous shortage of personal protective equipment; spurred by a sense of duty, they flocked from across the country to the newest hot zones, sometimes working as volunteers. More than 1,200 of them have died from the virus.

Spurred by a sense of duty? Not fair compensation, y'all, a sense of duty.

“You want to be there in someone’s moment of need, but when you are in disaster mode and trying to keep your finger on the leak in the dike, you can’t give every patient the care they deserve,” said Dr. LouAnn Woodward, the medical center’s top executive.

And who is liable in court when a patient doesn't get the care they deserve? Is it executives? What would HR have to say if I charted ""cannot give patient the care they deserve due to disaster?""

Multiple surveys suggest that nurses are feeling increasingly embattled: the unrelenting workloads, the moral injury caused by their inability to provide quality care, and dismay as emergency rooms fill with unvaccinated patients

Is the rage I feel about being paid 1/6th as much as a manager of Buc-ee's to watch people drown to death, a moral injury? You're right NYT, maybe I should just control my emotions a little better.

Texas Emergency Hospital ... has been losing experienced nurses to recruiters who offer $20,000 signing bonuses and $140-an-hour wages. Texas Emergency, by contrast, pays its nurses $43 an hour with a $2 stipend for those on the night shift. “That’s ridiculous money, which gives you a sense of how desperate everyone is,” said Patti Foster, the chief operations officer of the system

Dear New York Times, I am disappointed to see that you are complicit in the messaging that has led to the historic and unprecedented abuse of nurses, aides, respiratory therapists, EMS, housekeepers and hospital security staff in the past 18 months. Your editorial choice to interview seven individuals in administrative & research roles and only two actual bedside nurses is a spectacular insult to those of us who have spent, at this point, thousands of hours of our lives working through the horrific conditions that administrators and researchers have created in an attempt to maximize profits.
We are not ""spurred by a sense of duty."" We are spurred by the need to pay our bills. Managers at Buc-ee's gas stations are paid 3-5x as much as ER/ICU nurses in most of the areas where the remorseful (and visibly well-rested) healthcare executives from your article are unable to hire staff.
We are not suffering ""moral injury"" from the horrific conditions that administrators and researchers have created. We are suffering permanent lung damage from COVID-19 infections that could have been prevented had hospital leadership provided enough single-use N-95 masks, instead of instructing us to place the same mask in a brown paper bag to ""sanitize"" overnight for reuse the next day. We are suffering from the highest levels of back injury and physical assault of any profession, because administrators and researchers have determined that hiring lift teams and security staff is not financially prudent.
We are not ""workhorses,"" to quote your article. We are people, who want to be PAID FAIRLY for the risks that we take. We are not children; we do not want pizza or a goody bag of useless plastic and candy. We are not heroes. We are the workers without which healthcare cannot function. Until we are given fair wages and fair representation in hospital leadership, the ""shortage"" will only become worse.

73,2022-02-26T11:25:46+00:00,Old_Signal1507,"Patients ordering door dash","I honestly don’t like when patients ask for food during night shift and you have to tell them the kitchen is closed, so they order DoorDash at almost midnight and ask you to go down to the hospital entrance to get the food for them. It’s even worse when you find out they’re on a specific diet and they’re ordering food they know they shouldn’t be eating
Edit: I honestly should have clarified this post a little more so I apologize for any misunderstanding in the comments, it was on me. I’m getting tired of repeating myself in the comments so I’ll just clarify. I understand that some patients are hungry, and being hungry in the middle of the night is very uncomfortable and hospital food is ridiculously expensive. However for some of us, it’s out of our scope of practice to get food for the patient that’s coming from outside of the hospital. Or if it’s in our scope, some of us can’t just drop what we’re doing to go off the unit and bring the patient food because we’re trying to give care to other patients. I don’t need to get into NPO statuses, aspiration risks, fluid restrictions, or calorie restrictions because it’s pretty obvious why we can’t just do whatever the patient wants during those circumstances. There’s nothing wrong with being compassionate to your patient, but be mindful of the potential situation you’re putting them in, especially when there’s specific things affecting their diet. They’re in the hospital for a reason.
Side note, I was just made aware of this by someone who door dashes in the comments so I’ll post the quote here:

Plus they will be getting hazard pay of $15 extra an hour for working with covid patients The nurser gets there and I am waiting on my relief to get there so I can give the new tech report and leave. The nurse is livid that we are moving her because she isn't vaccinated, even though the hospital has offered it for a year at no cost, and doesn't want to work with covid patients. The nurse is also a covid denier who is unvaccinated. So she is upset she will be made to work, unvaccinated, with patients sick with a disease she does not believe exists. How can you be upset about that?",3108,"465 comments",https://old.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/prh8lj/covid_denier_nurse_mad_they_have_to_have_covid/,0.133,0.851,0.016,-0.9606
