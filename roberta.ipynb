I waited until literally the night before our science fair project was due to begin it. My mom did not help. My mom did not write email after email to my teacher making excuses, begging for more time, and spinning a sob story of how hard I tried. No, my mom let me fail. I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúfail.‚Äù I probably earned a C, but for a student who typically earned As, it was a failure to me. While I may have procrastinated a few times after, it was never to the extent of what happened with that science fair project. Parents: You are failing your child by not letting them fail. One ‚ÄúC‚Äù in middle school isn‚Äôt the end of the world, and it‚Äôs much better to earn that C in middle school rather than in high school where the GPA counts more heavily. GPA isn‚Äôt really a thing in middle school until 8th grade. Your child should not have waited until the DAY BEFORE THE EXTRA CREDIT was due to begin it. Your child should know how to check and read his emails. Your child should know that he will not get credit for plagiarizing his assignment. Your child would have those horrible feelings of failure and disappointment to motivate him not to make those mistakes again if you hadn‚Äôt sent me a barrage of emails, if your husband, a 35-year veteran teacher who apparently has no clue what plagiarism is, hadn‚Äôt sent me emails, and if administration hadn‚Äôt stepped in to force my hand to offer your precious baby a second chance on extra credit. In the future, just tell me what grade you want your kid to have. It will save both of us time and frustration.\", 27)\n"

      "('I went into this school year ready for anything. That \"anything\" didn\\'t include 95% of what hit me like a freight train in just my first week. The kids that got dropped in my lap this year were beyond anything I ever expected. \\nOn day 1, I had a student (5th Grade ELA) stand on his desk and beat on his chest while screaming absolute nonsense. It wasn\\'t even words. It was just guttural noise. This student proceeded to jump down and crawl on the floor across my classroom. All I could do was stand there and think \"What the absolute fuck is happening?\". This same phrase has now become a constant in my mind.\\nI spent my first entire month crying after work on my drive home. Between the kids, constant crazy expectations, PD days everytime I turned around, and the \"can you help out with this or that\", I was dying. I seriously went to my doctor and asked him to please give whatever drugs, even experimental, you can to just help me handle all of this. *He didn\\'t do that, but did adjust some of meds to help with my anxiety. \\nMy biggest problem was that I wanted to teach, but felt like I was being pulled in some many different directions that I wasn\\'t even allowed to do my actual job. The night before I was about to put in my 2 week notice, it hit me. They aren\\'t going to fire me for not complying to half of the shit that they are wanting me to do. I\\'m ready to quit, so being fired, isn\\'t too much different (I know recommendations are needed on a resume, of course). \\nI decided to teach, really teach. If our district office came by to look at my data wall, I was already prepared to tell them \" Dat a Wall ain\\'t a happening\". I broke all of the stupid rules. I never had my students open their textbooks that I hated. I read 2 different novels and did activities with those novels that the kids loved. I refused meetings that weren\\'t beneficial or related to my actual planning during my planning period. I also quit working, grading, or planning after school. My room or lessons aren\\'t Pinterest perfect anymore, but that\\'s okay.\\nI was constantly second guessing my new approach, but I was happier. My students were also generally doing better. They were and are still crazy, but we\\'ve all developed a relationship in which we are able to manage it. \\nSo, did this work? As in, did my mandatory 9 week benchmark tests satisfy those above me? Did my craziness with the intention of doing what I felt was best for my students actually work? It actually did!!!! My 5th graders performed on their 9 weeks benchmark test higher than my class the year before. Their overall proficiency was higher than their beginning of the year benchmark and state test from last school year. 81% of all of my students passed that damn test too. My 5th graders also scored 15% higher on all aspects of the test compared to the rest of the district. \\nTLDR: I said fuck the crazy expectations and just focused on teaching even if it meant getting fired, because I was already ready to quit. I ended up having a group that performed better than they ever have on our stupid benchmark tests.', 28)\n"

      "I am irritated that parents aren‚Äôt letting their kids fail. I don‚Äôt have kids, but I was a kid whose mom let me fail, and miraculously, I learned from it and never made that mistake again. It was in 7th grade, the grade I currently teach. I waited until literally the night before our science fair project was due to begin it. My mom did not help. My mom did not write email after email to my teacher making excuses, begging for more time, and spinning a sob story of how hard I tried. No, my mom let me fail. I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúfail.‚Äù I probably earned a C, but for a student who typically earned As, it was a failure to me. While I may have procrastinated a few times after, it was never to the extent of what happened with that science fair project. Parents: You are failing your child by not letting them fail. One ‚ÄúC‚Äù in middle school isn‚Äôt the end of the world, and it‚Äôs much better to earn that C in middle school rather than in high school where the GPA counts more heavily. GPA isn‚Äôt really a thing in middle school until 8th grade. Your child should not have waited until the DAY BEFORE THE EXTRA CREDIT was due to begin it. Your child should know how to check and read his emails. Your child should know that he will not get credit for plagiarizing his assignment. Your child would have those horrible feelings of failure and disappointment to motivate him not to make those mistakes again if you hadn‚Äôt sent me a barrage of emails, if your husband, a 35-year veteran teacher who apparently has no clue what plagiarism is, hadn‚Äôt sent me emails, and if administration hadn‚Äôt stepped in to force my hand to offer your precious baby a second chance on extra credit.

      "On day 1, I had a student (5th Grade ELA) stand on his desk and beat on his chest while screaming absolute nonsense. It wasn't even words. It was just guttural noise.

The night before I was about to put in my 2 week notice, it hit me. They aren't going to fire me for not complying to half of the shit that they are wanting me to do. I'm ready to quit, so being fired, isn't too much different (I know recommendations are needed on a resume, of course). \n",
      "I decided to teach, really teach. If our district office came by to look at my data wall, I was already prepared to tell them \" Dat a Wall ain't a happening\". I broke all of the stupid rules. I never had my students open their textbooks that I hated. I read 2 different novels and did activities with those novels that the kids loved. I refused meetings that weren't beneficial or related to my actual planning during my planning period. I also quit working, grading, or planning after school. My room or lessons aren't Pinterest perfect anymore, but that's okay.\n",

Their overall proficiency was higher than their beginning of the year benchmark and state test from last school year. 81% of all of my students passed that damn test too. My 5th graders also scored 15% higher on all aspects of the test compared to the rest of the district. \n",

Their parents phone and want instructions on how to eat lobster. I also show them how with instructions, a video, and several books on the subject. The kid decides they don‚Äôt like lobster, even though they haven‚Äôt taken a single bite. I offer them a different dish. They leave. Their parents complain that I didn‚Äôt feed them. They leave after the first week.\n",
      "12 complain about the food selection, even though I have carefully adapted my menu to serve vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian, paleo, low-sodium, low-carb, gluten-free, and check for allergens for each kid. I went to several meetings and courses to learn how to make these dishes. Their parents complain because I didn‚Äôt have a keto plate. Two parents thanks me for the support with their kid's low-sodium meals. They leave the restaurant after two weeks, but I still have to call and see if they want to come and eat. I feel like an annoying telemarketer, they don‚Äôt even pick up the phone now.\n",

They ask every night for this, even though I've been working all year to try and get them to eat on their own. I can't serve other kids because I get tied up trying to feed so many individuals. Sometimes I will get lucky and can get a waiter to help me cut up the food, but with budget cuts, my restaurant can't afford that many waiters. I wonder why their parents haven‚Äôt taught them how to use utensils yet, but quickly find out that their parents have been cutting their food for them their whole lives. They leave after the third week.\n",

      "8 kids want me to deliver the food to them. It‚Äôs a bit more work, but I have no problems doing it. I adapt my menu so they get hot food, and I even use my own plates. When the waiters deliver the food now, they won‚Äôt answer the door. I never get my plates back.\n",
      "7 kids leave their food virtually untouched, only picking out the pieces they like and leaving the rest. Their parents want to know what their kid ate every day, even though they could simply ask their kid. Or check their dining app. Or their emails.\n",
      "12 kids show up when their parents force them, pretend to eat the food, but actually dump their plate into the trash can when their parents aren't looking. I ask them if they want another plate, but they don't respond. They show their parents the empty plate, and parents are too busy to notice. I don't blame the parents because I know they're stressed and overworked, but I still worry about their kids.\n",
      "16 kids show up on time, eat the food, and even say thank-you. They fill my heart so full I could cry. I want to hug their parents. I am so thankful for these students because they remind me why I chose to become a chef for a living. It's not a job, it's a career and a large part of my identity.\n",
      "Running the food truck is exhausting, but the relaxed dress code is a perk. I‚Äôm lucky because I don‚Äôt have my own kids to feed and nurture, on top of running the restaurant. I don‚Äôt know how those chefs do it. I hope I can go back to my restaurant, but with the flooding, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll have a job there in the fall. I wonder if all chefs feel this way.\n",

      "Apologies in advance for this rant... My district recently had a PD session addressing the issue of burnout--good for them for recognizing the problem--but the speaker was condescending and awful. I won't name them or their program. They started off talking about how stressful their four or five years in the classroom were. Then during a cry in the parking lot they apparently had this wild revelation about needing to feel burned-in instead of burnt-out. They left the classroom and opted for the PD circuit instead.\n",
      "Coming at the end of a school year where my school had four different schedules and all of us felt like first-year teachers again, the PD speaker's presentation felt downright insulting. They haven't been in the classroom for at least four years. They didn't experience spring 2020. They haven't seen any of the stress and horror we've seen this year. To be blunt, the speaker couldn't hack it in a regular classroom and decided to make themselves feel good telling other professionals how to do a job they couldn't handle for themselves. I had a student teacher last semester. I would rather listen to an eight-hour presentation from her than five minutes from the burnt-in speaker because at least my former student teacher understands what we've gone through this year. \n",
      "This is not to say that any PD speaker who left the classroom shouldn't speak to teachers. There are some phenomenal people out there who have earned the right to tell us how to improve. Manny Scott, in particular, is an absolute inspiration. I love him and his books. \n",
      "On the PD evaluation, I and my PLC wrote we would walk out if administration ever invited that speaker back again. After all we've been through, administrators must be more careful in who they select to come see us and tell us how to improve in our jobs. They have to get people who understand what the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 years have been like for us. The PD speaker circuit is filled with people who abandoned their classrooms a long time ago and wouldn't last a week in today's classrooms. Teachers have to stand up for our profession and relevant PD so those non-contact days matter.\n",

They‚Äôll be in another meet with friends while also in class, editing google docs with friends, won‚Äôt open assignments during work time even with prompts. On Friday I point blank said ‚Äúdo this assignment, it‚Äôs the easiest to do and you‚Äôll finish within 20 mins‚Äù. Nope. Fine, there‚Äôs other kids who need my help. \n",
      "I was working from home so I had one laptop open in google meets with my classes, and another I used to watch their screens and answer questions through chat. I‚Äôm answering questions through chat and helping students through google docs, also talking to kids verbally so they knew I was still there (a true juggling act) when I hear an email notification. The parent of the student mentioned earlier accuses me of being on social media instead of teaching. They also say their student could really use my help getting caught up rather than sitting on my computer. \n",
      "I am.... still enraged. Responded respectfully explaining that while it may look like I‚Äôm slacking, I‚Äôm helping students work on another laptop. I mentioned their student declined to work that day.\n",
      "Even when I know and have proof that I‚Äôm in the right, these parent emails are still so hurtful. Do we eventually get over this?\n",

YOU WILL BE IN 8th GRADE THEN I DO NOT WANT YOUR 7th GRADE WORK IN 8th GRADE. She has told me this now on almost every assignment and every time I tell her no if you don‚Äôt turn it in you won‚Äôt get credit. I need it this year not next year. She always says ‚ÄúOk, Mister‚Äù and then does the exact same thing next assignment! In 7 weeks I have received 1 complete assignment she has repeatedly turned down offers for assistance and tutoring and in 7 weeks of 2 zoom classes a week she‚Äôs shown up once.

      "Sitting in a doctor's waiting room (for more than an hour, by the way). Overheard a conversation about schools just starting to going back 5 days a week and then taking \"Spring Break.\" Sadly, the conversation was not supportive - basically it was \"What do the kids need a break for? They just went back to school!?\"\n",

      "Had a true dream come true today. A current senior who I taught when she was in 8th grade emailed me last night asking when she could come see me. We‚Äôve stayed close throughout the years and I usually meet with her 5-6 times a year to help mentor her. She‚Äôs launched an astronomy club at her high school which take on pretty amazing initiatives that I help with in any way I can. She‚Äôs been to two highly competitive NASA summer internships, as well as one at Cal Tech and most recently at Yale. She fell in love with the campus and community while there and knew it was her dream school. \n",
      "Well today she came to tell me she got accepted into Yale to pursue a degree in Astrophysics. She videoed herself logging into to see if she got accepted and it‚Äôs one of the most beautiful things I‚Äôve ever seen. She then told me she talked about me during her interview. She said she didn‚Äôt know she loved space  and physics until my class. \n",
